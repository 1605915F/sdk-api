# _KF_DEFINITION_FLAGS enumeration


## -description


Flags that specify certain known folder behaviors. Used with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/08bd8406-68fa-4e02-9a64-ed5e62f8639b">KNOWNFOLDER_DEFINITION</a> structure.


## -enum-fields




### -field KFDF_LOCAL_REDIRECT_ONLY

Prevent a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2ca0d3e2-bb4c-4a28-90d6-fe2852373b88">per-user</a> known folder from being redirected to a network location. Note that if the known folder has been flagged with KFDF_LOCAL_REDIRECT_ONLY but it is a subfolder of a known folder that is redirected to a network location, this subfolder is redirected also.


### -field KFDF_ROAMABLE

Can be roamed through a PC-to-PC synchronization.


### -field KFDF_PRECREATE

Create the folder when the user first logs on. Normally a known folder is not created until it is first called. At that time, an API such as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dc75ee60-7319-4a11-949e-dd0c3deabd8f">SHCreateItemInKnownFolder</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a42c0a20-9c72-48d3-8432-15b73ff211d2">IKnownFolder::GetShellItem</a> is called with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd378447(v=VS.85).aspx">KF_FLAG_CREATE</a> flag. However, some known folders need to exist immediately. An example is those known folders under %USERPROFILE%, which must exist to provide a proper view. In those cases, KFDF_PRECREATE is set and Windows Explorer calls the creation API during its user initialization.


### -field KFDF_STREAM

<b>Introduced in Windows 7</b>. The known folder is a file rather than a folder.


### -field KFDF_PUBLISHEXPANDEDPATH

<b>Introduced in Windows 7</b>. The full path of the known folder, with any environment variables fully expanded, is stored in the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.


### -field KFDF_NO_REDIRECT_UI

<b>Introduced in Windows 8.1</b>. Prevent showing the <b>Locations</b> tab in the property dialog of the known folder. 

<b>Introduced in Windows 8.1</b>. Prevent showing the <b>Locations</b> tab in the property dialog of the known folder.
