# IFolderView::GetSpacing


## -description


Gets a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ecb0f0e1-90c2-48ab-a069-552262b49c7c">POINT</a> structure containing the width (x) and height (y) dimensions, including the surrounding white space, of an item.


## -parameters




### -param ppt [in, out]

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ecb0f0e1-90c2-48ab-a069-552262b49c7c">POINT</a>*</b>

A pointer to an existing structure to be filled with the current sizing dimensions of the items in the folder's view.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



As an example, consider an icon measuring 75 pixels by 70 pixels, with its upper-left corner located at pixel (0,0). Note that this measurement includes both the visible graphic and its surrounding buffer area. <b>IFolderView::GetSpacing</b> would return a pointer to a POINT structure containing an x value of 75 and a y value of 70. If you were using this information to avoid overlap, the next icon in line to the right would be placed with its upper-left corner at pixel (75,0). Similarly, the next icon below would be placed at pixel (0,70).
