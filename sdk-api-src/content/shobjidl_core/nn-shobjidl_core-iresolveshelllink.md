## -remarks



Namespace extensions implement this object to support link resolution.

This interface is not typically used by applications.

With <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cc387338-15fa-4350-b039-61a0f1c5030a">namespace extensions</a>, shortcut objects (.lnk files) implement the essential functionality of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a31f1d6d-7b87-4777-89a8-a032b7629b7e">IShellLink::Resolve</a> by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2cf849f6-e7b4-4280-98d7-4dcc20039624">IResolveShellLink::ResolveShellLink</a>. <b>IResolveShellLink</b> is exported by a link resolution object that is created on request by the Shell folder.

To retrieve a pointer to a link resolution object's <b>IResolveShellLink</b> interface:
				

<ul>
<li>For an object that is contained by a folder, call the folder's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ec863dbf-8ec9-4952-8912-575125e6dd09">IShellFolder::GetUIObjectOf</a> method and request an <b>IResolveShellLink</b> pointer (IID_IResolveShellLink).</li>
<li>For the folder object itself, call the folder's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8a1b73ad-6719-403a-a8aa-27bef537b7a9">IShellFolder::CreateViewObject</a> method and request an <b>IResolveShellLink</b> pointer (IID_IResolveShellLink).</li>
</ul>
