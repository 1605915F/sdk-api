A software component (either an OS component or an application) taat can launch a dual-mode application such as a browser should implement this interface. The interface should be implemented on an object that can be reached through the site chain provided to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7850d19c-dadb-44a1-85d9-d5b897edb39f">ShellExecuteEx</a> or the context menu and retrieved through the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Cc678966(v=VS.85).aspx">IServiceProvider::QueryService</a> method.
