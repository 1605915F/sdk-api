# IFileOperation::PerformOperations


## -description


Executes all selected operations.


## -parameters






## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns S_OK if successful, or an error value otherwise. Note that if the operation was canceled by the user, this method can still return a success code. Use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/988f78a8-3a50-44d8-9214-7cf71be72d38">GetAnyOperationsAborted</a> method to determine if this was the case.




## -remarks



This method is called last to execute those actions that have been specified earlier by calling their individual methods. For instance, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2f72b729-3535-4ab7-9579-21b1ba97c67f">RenameItem</a> does not rename the item, it simply sets the parameters. The actual renaming is done when you call <b>PerformOperations</b>.
