# STPFLAG enumeration


## -description


Used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cc3fec4b-7770-44af-9892-239a17dd96b8">ITaskbarList4::SetTabProperties</a> method to specify tab properties.


## -enum-fields




### -field STPF_NONE

No specific property values are specified. The default behavior is used: the tab window provides a thumbnail and peek image, either live or static as appropriate.


### -field STPF_USEAPPTHUMBNAILALWAYS

Always use the thumbnail provided by the main application frame window rather than a thumbnail provided by the individual tab window. Do not combine this value with STPF_USEAPPTHUMBNAILWHENACTIVE; doing so will result in an error.


### -field STPF_USEAPPTHUMBNAILWHENACTIVE

When the application tab is active and a live representation of its window is available, use the main application's frame window thumbnail. At other times, use the tab window thumbnail. Do not combine this value with STPF_USEAPPTHUMBNAILALWAYS; doing so will result in an error.


### -field STPF_USEAPPPEEKALWAYS

Always use the peek image provided by the main application frame window rather than a peek image provided by the individual tab window. Do not combine this value with STPF_USEAPPPEEKWHENACTIVE; doing so will result in an error.


### -field STPF_USEAPPPEEKWHENACTIVE

When the application tab is active and a live representation of its window is available, show the main application frame in the peek feature. At other times, use the tab window. Do not combine this value with STPF_USEAPPPEEKALWAYS; doing so will result in an error.
