# SHResolveLibrary function


## -description


Resolves all locations in a library, even those locations that have been moved or renamed.


## -parameters




### -param psiLibrary [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/599b9c0a-df04-4dbd-a5a6-a8736eecc560">IShellItem</a>*</b>

A pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/599b9c0a-df04-4dbd-a5a6-a8736eecc560">IShellItem</a> object that represents the library.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



This function can block the calling thread for as long as it takes to resolve all the locations in the specified library. Because it blocks the thread from which it is called, it should not be called from a thread that also handles user interface interactions.

This function resolves all locations in the specified library in a single call. To resolve an individual location in a library, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3d867a1-7396-4fba-87ea-45b02f86d681">IShellLibrary::ResolveFolder</a> method or the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e9c8aacd-9abb-4640-b9ed-1fa417d4d4cc">SHResolveFolderPathInLibrary</a> function.
