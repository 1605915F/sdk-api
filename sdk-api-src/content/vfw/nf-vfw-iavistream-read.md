# IAVIStream::Read


## -description



The <b>Read</b> method reads data from a stream and copies it to an application-defined buffer. If no buffer is supplied, it determines the buffer size needed to retrieve the next buffer of data. Called when an application uses the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9490d46f-b11d-466b-a756-092df2db0306">AVIStreamRead</a> function.




## -parameters




### -param lStart

Starting sample or frame number to read.


### -param lSamples

Number of samples to read.


### -param lpBuffer

Pointer to the application-defined buffer to contain the stream data. You can also specify <b>NULL</b> to request the required size of the buffer. Many applications precede each read operation with a query for the buffer size to see how large a buffer is needed.


### -param cbBuffer

Size, in bytes, of the buffer specified by <i>lpBuffer</i>.


### -param plBytes

Pointer to a buffer that receives the number of bytes read.


### -param plSamples

Pointer to a buffer that receives the number of samples read.


#### - ps

Pointer to the interface to a stream.


## -returns



Returns AVIERR_OK if successful or AVIERR_BUFFERTOOSMALL if the buffer is not large enough to hold the data. If successful, <b>Read</b> also returns either a buffer of data with the number of frames (samples) included in the buffer or the required buffer size, in bytes.




## -remarks



For handlers written in C++, <b>Read</b> has the following syntax:


```cpp

HRESULT Read(LONG lStart, LONG lSamples, 
    LPVOID lpBuffer, LONG cbBuffer, 
    LONG *plBytes, LONG *plSamples); 
 

```
