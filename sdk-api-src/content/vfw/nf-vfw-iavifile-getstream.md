# IAVIFile::GetStream


## -description



The <b>GetStream</b> method opens a stream by accessing it in a file. Called when an application uses the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b51a823c-6904-4942-883f-bda347541757">AVIFileGetStream</a> function.




## -parameters




### -param ppStream

Pointer to a buffer that receives a pointer to the interface to a stream.


### -param fccType

Four-character code indicating the type of stream to locate.


### -param lParam

Stream number.


#### - pf

Pointer to the interface to a file.


## -returns



Returns the HRESULT defined by OLE.




## -remarks



It is typically easier to implement this method by creating all of the stream objects in advance by using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4a0c0154-ea38-471d-94c3-799a6ba47c2f">IAVIFile::Open</a> method. Then, this method accesses the interface to the specified stream.

Remember to increment the reference count maintained by the <b>AddRef</b> method for the stream when this method is used.

For handlers written in C++, GetStream has the following syntax:


```cpp

HRESULT GetStream(PAVISTREAM *ppStream, 
    DWORD fccType, LONG lParam); 
 

```
