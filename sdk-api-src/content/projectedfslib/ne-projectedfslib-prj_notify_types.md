</ul>

### -field PRJ_NOTIFY_PRE_DELETE

If received in a notification:

<ul>

### -field PRJ_NOTIFY_PRE_RENAME

If received in a notification:

<ul>
<li>A file or folder is about to be renamed.</li>
<li>If the provider returns an error HRESULT code from the callback, the rename will not take effect.</li>
<li>If the callbackData-&gt;FilePathName parameter of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nc-projectedfslib-prj_notification_cb">PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</a> is an empty string, this indicates that the rename is moving the file/directory from outside the virtualization instance. In that case, this notification will always be sent if the provider has registered a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nc-projectedfslib-prj_notification_cb">PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</a> callback, even if the provider did not specify this bit when registering the subtree containing the destination path.

</li>
<li>If both the callbackData-&gt;FilePathName and destinationFileName parameters of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nc-projectedfslib-prj_notification_cb">PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</a> are non-empty strings, this indicates that the new hard link will be created within the virtualization instance for a file that exists within the virtualization instance.

<li>The provider can specify a new notification mask for this file/directory when responding to the notification.</li>
</ul>
If specified on virtualization instance start:

</li>
<li>If the callbackData-&gt;FilePathName parameter of PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB is an empty string, this indicates that the hard link name was created inside the virtualization instance, i.e. a new hard link was created inside the virtualization instance to a file that exists outside the virtualization instance.

</li>
<li>If the destinationFileName parameter of PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB is an empty string, this indicates that the hard link name was created outside the virtualization instance, i.e. a new hard link was created outside the virtualization instance for a file that exists inside the virtualization instance. 
</li>
<li>If both the callbackData-&gt;FilePathName and destinationFileName parameters of PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB are non-empty strings, this indicates that the a new hard link was created within the virtualization instance for a file that exists within the virtualization instance.

</ul>
If specified on virtualization instance start:

<ul>
<li>Indicates that the provider should be notified that a hard link has been created for a file.</li>
</ul>
If specified in response to a notification:

<ul>
<li>The provider should be notified when a handle is closed on a file/folder and the closing handle neither modified nor deleted it.</li>
</ul>
If specified in response to a notification:

<ul>
<li>The provider should be notified when handles are closed for the file/folder and there were no modifications or deletions associated with the closing handle.</li>
</ul>

### -field PRJ_NOTIFY_FILE_HANDLE_CLOSED_FILE_MODIFIED

If received in a notification:

<ul>
<li>A handle has been closed on the file, and that the file’s content was modified while the handle was open.</li>

If received in a notification:

<ul>
<li>A handle has been closed on the file/folder, and that it was deleted as part of closing the handle. 
</li>
<li>If the provider also registered to receive PRJ_NOTIFY_FILE_HANDLE_CLOSED_FILE_MODIFIED notifications, and the file was modified using the handle whose close resulted in deleting the file, then the operationParameters-&gt;FileDeletedOnHandleClose.IsFileModified parameter of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nc-projectedfslib-prj_notification_cb">PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</a> will be TRUE.

## -remarks



ProjFS can send notifications of file system activity to a provider. When the provider starts a virtualization instance it specifies which notifications it wishes to receive. It may also specify a new set of notifications for a file when it is created or renamed. The provider must register a PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB notification callback routine in the callbacks parameter of PrjStartVirtualizing in order to receive notifications. 


ProjFS sends notifications for files and directories within an active virtualization root. That is, ProjFS will send notifications for the virtualization root and its descendants. Symbolic links and junctions within the virtualization root are not traversed when determining what constitutes a descendant of the virtualization root. 


ProjFS sends notifications only for the primary data stream of a file. ProjFS does not send notifications for operations on alternate data streams. 



ProjFS does not send notifications for an inactive virtualization instance. A virtualization instance is inactive if any one of the following is true: 

<ul>
<li>The provider has not yet started it by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nf-projectedfslib-prjstartvirtualizing">PrjStartVirtualizing</a>.</li>
<li>The provider has stopped the instance by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nf-projectedfslib-prjstopvirtualizing">PrjStopVirtualizing</a>.</li>
<li>The provider process has exited</li>
</ul> 
The provider may specify which notifications it wishes to receive when starting a virtualization instance, or in response to a notification that allows a new notification mask to be set. 


The provider specifies a default set of notifications that it wants ProjFS to send for the virtualization instance when it starts the instance. This set of notifications is provided in the NotificationMappings member of the options parameter of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nf-projectedfslib-prjstartvirtualizing">PrjStartVirtualizing</a>, which may specify different notification masks for different subtrees of the virtualization instance. 


The provider may choose to supply a different notification mask in response to a notification of file open, create, supersede/overwrite, or rename. ProjFS will continue to send these notifications for the given file until all handles to the file are closed. After that it will revert to the default set of notifications. Naturally if the default set of notifications does not specify that ProjFS should notify for open, create, etc., the provider will not get the opportunity to specify a different mask for those operations.
