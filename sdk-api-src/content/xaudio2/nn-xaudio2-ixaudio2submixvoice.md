# IXAudio2SubmixVoice interface


## -description


A submix voice is used primarily for performance improvements and effects processing. 


## -remarks



Data buffers cannot be submitted directly to submix voices and will not be audible unless submitted to a mastering voice. A submix voice can be used to ensure that a particular set of voice data is converted to the same format and/or to have a particular effect chain processed on the collective result. 


IXAudio2SubmixVoice inherits directly from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Ee415917(v=VS.85).aspx">IXAudio2Voice</a>, but does not implement methods specific to submix voices. The interface type exists solely because some of the base class methods are implemented differently for submix voices. Having a separate type for these voices helps client code to distinguish the different voice types and to benefit from C++ type safety.
