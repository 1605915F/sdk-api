# IPipeByte::Pull


## -description


Retrieves data of the byte type from the pipe source.


## -parameters




### -param buf [out]

A pointer to the memory buffer that receives the data. The buffer must be able to hold at least the number of bytes specified in <i>cRequest</i>.


### -param cRequest [in]

The number of bytes requested.


### -param pcReturned [out]

The actual number of bytes returned.


## -returns



This method returns S_OK to indicate that the data was retrieved successfully.




## -remarks



When the <b>Pull</b> method is called, data is requested from the provider of the pipe. The caller must provide a buffer that will hold at least the number of bytes specified in the <i>cRequest</i> parameter. The proxy will unmarshal the data into the provided buffer and set the number of bytes actually provided in <i>pcReturned</i>. The <i>pcReturned</i> parameter can be less than or equal to <i>cRequest</i>, but it will never be greater. When <i>pcReturned</i> is 0, it indicates that there is no more data.
