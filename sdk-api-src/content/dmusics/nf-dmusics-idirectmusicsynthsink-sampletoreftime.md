# IDirectMusicSynthSink::SampleToRefTime


## -description


The <code>SampleToRefTime</code> method converts a sample time to a reference time.


## -parameters




### -param llSampleTime

Specifies the sample time. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


### -param prfTime

Output pointer for the reference time. This parameter points to a caller-allocated REFERENCE_TIME variable into which the method writes the reference time.


## -returns



<code>SampleToRefTime</code> returns S_OK if the call is successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code. 




## -remarks



The <code>SampleToRefTime</code> method converts sample time to reference time. Sample time is expressed as the number of samples rendered, and reference time is measured in 100-nanosecond units.

The synth sink manages the timing relationship between the master clock (set with a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/91c996cc-04e1-47fb-a82d-1cb17fe191e2">IDirectMusicSynthSink::SetMasterClock</a>) and the audio stream.

For more information, see the description of reference time and sample time in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/38aca8b7-f895-4b16-aaac-5a13973cf976">Synthesizer Timing</a>.
