# FwpmFreeMemory0 function


## -description


The <b>FwpmFreeMemory0</b> function is used to release memory resources allocated by the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) functions.


## -parameters




### -param p [in, out]

Type: <b>void**</b>

Address of the pointer to be freed.


## -returns



This function does not return a value.




## -remarks



<b>FwpmFreeMemory0</b> is used to free memory returned by the various <b>Fwpm*</b> functions, such as <b>FwpmFilterGetByKey0</b>.

<b>Fwpm*</b> functions that return a HANDLE, such as <b>FwpmCalloutCreateEnumHandle0</b>, have specific functions to release memory.

If the caller passes a pointer that is not valid, the behavior is undefined.

<b>FwpmFreeMemory0</b> is a specific implementation of FwpmFreeMemory. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/FBDF53E5-F7DE-4DEB-AC18-6D2BB59FE670">WFP Version-Independent Names and Targeting Specific Versions of Windows</a>  for more information.
