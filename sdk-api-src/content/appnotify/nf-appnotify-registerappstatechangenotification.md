# RegisterAppStateChangeNotification function

### -param Routine [in]

A pointer to a callback function that is called when the app enters or leaves the suspended state. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/AA5B09FA-2016-4C9D-8DE3-CD3C6141B45A">PAPPSTATE_CHANGE_ROUTINE</a> for more detail on this function.


### -param Context [in, optional]

App-specific context information that the app uses when going into or out of a suspended state. This is commonly a "this" pointer.


### -param Registration [out]
