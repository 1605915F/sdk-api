# IX509CertificateRequestCmc::get_NullSigned


## -description


The <b>NullSigned</b> property retrieves a Boolean value that specifies whether the primary signature  on the certificate request is null-signed.

This property is read-only.


## -parameters


## -remarks



A null-signed certificate request is not really signed. That is, the request can be digested by using a digest algorithm such as SHA-1, but it is not encrypted with a public key algorithm such as RSA. This can be used when a private key is not available as is often the case when <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/db46def4-bfdc-4801-a57d-d568e94a2dbb">certification authorities</a> are being cross-certified.

You must initialize the CMC request object before calling this property. For more information, see the following topics:<ul>
