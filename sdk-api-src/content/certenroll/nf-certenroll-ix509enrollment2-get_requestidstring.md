# IX509Enrollment2::get_RequestIdString


## -description


The <b>RequestIdString</b> property retrieves a string that contains a unique identifier for the certificate request sent to the certification enrollment server (CES).

This property is read-only.


## -parameters


## -remarks



The value of the <b>RequestIdString</b> property is set during the enrollment process. It can be used during subsequent communication between the client and the CES. For example, if a CES marks a request as pending when initially submitted, the client can use the request ID string when it again contacts the CES and attempts to retrieve the certificate response.
