# IX509Enrollment::get_Response


## -description


The <b>Response</b> property retrieves the certificate response returned from a certification authority. The response is contained in a byte array that is encoded by using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721573(v=VS.85).aspx">Distinguished Encoding Rules</a> (DER) as defined by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721532(v=VS.85).aspx">Abstract Syntax Notation One</a> (ASN.1) standard.  The DER-encoded byte array is represented by a string that is  either a pure binary sequence or Unicode encoded.

This property is read-only.
