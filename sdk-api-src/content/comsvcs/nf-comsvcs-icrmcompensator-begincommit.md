# ICrmCompensator::BeginCommit


## -description


Notifies the CRM Compensator of the commit phase of the transaction completion and that records are about to be delivered.


## -parameters




### -param fRecovery [in]

Indicates whether this method is being called during recovery (TRUE) or normal processing (FALSE).


## -returns



If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The commit or abort phases are received by the compensator without a prepare phase during recovery. Also, the abort phase can be received during normal processing without a prepare phase if the client decides to initiate abort.

The CRM Compensator should not depend on any state to be maintained between the prepare and commit/abort phases; the CRM infrastructure is free to release the CRM Compensator between these two phases if it needs to do so. However, state is maintained between the Begin-Record-End calls, and the CRM Compensator always gets the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3309ed58-8161-46f3-93bc-afc0c9bc8d50">ICrmLogControl</a> interface before delivery of any transaction outcome methods.
