# ISendMethodEvents interface


## -description


Describes an event class that notifies subscribers whenever a method on the object that implements it either is called or returns from a call. The events are published to the subscriber using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1e0570ae-9099-465a-9133-72aa7d574932">COM+ Events</a> service, a loosely coupled events system that stores event information from different publishers in an event store in the COM+ catalog.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ISendMethodEvents</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ISendMethodEvents</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Generated when a method called through a component interface returns control to the caller.

</tr>

## -remarks



To send method events to the COM+ tracker property, you need to obtain a handle to it and you need to obtain its GUID, which is defined as follows.

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>GUID guidTrkPropPolicy = {0xecabaeb3, 0x7f19, 0x11d2, {0x97, 0x8e, 0x00, 0x00, 0xf8, 0x75, 0x7e, 0x2a}}
</code></pre>
To obtain a handle to the COM+ tracker property, call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/76c6f790-9103-4cee-8a67-0f69b00ba0a1">IContext::GetProperty</a> method with the <i>rGuid</i> argument set equal to this GUID.
