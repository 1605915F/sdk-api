# IObjectContext::SetComplete


## -description


Declares that the transaction in which the object is executing can be committed and that the object should be deactivated when it returns from the currently executing method call.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method can return the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_UNEXPECTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An unexpected error occurred. This can happen if one object passes its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9395bc9a-dfe5-428a-839f-1c4ad090f636">IObjectContext</a> pointer to another object and the other object calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8ff25b68-fcb3-4e11-9c74-b49b31806796">SetComplete</a> using this pointer. An <b>IObjectContext</b> pointer is not valid outside the context of the object that originally obtained it.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



The object is deactivated automatically on return from the method in which it called <b>SetComplete</b>. If the object is the root of an automatic transaction, COM+ attempts to commit the transaction. However, if any object that was participating in the transaction has called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c254305f-1fc5-417e-b93b-d5e2b36e9e39">SetAbort</a>, or has called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e83d1223-9b8e-4a92-b98d-9d2b6ed34721">DisableCommit</a> and has not subsequently called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6571aadc-bf5a-48c3-817a-66ce444ef96a">EnableCommit</a> or <b>SetComplete</b>, the transaction is aborted.

If an object does not need to maintain its state after it returns from a method call, it should call <b>SetComplete</b> so that it can be automatically deactivated as soon as it returns and its resources can be reclaimed.
