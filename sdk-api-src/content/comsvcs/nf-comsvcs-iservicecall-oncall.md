# IServiceCall::OnCall


## -description


Triggers the execution of the batch work implemented in this method.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_FAIL, and S_OK.




## -remarks



The batch work that is run in this method runs in the context and thread apartment of the activity that was created by the call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3009eb4f-e3f3-497b-ba05-5b750d8a40d0">CoCreateActivity</a>. The batch work in this method is run through a call to either <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d25e6942-7b1b-4b74-b711-2d0f513d0b38">SynchronousCall</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1d81f2e6-9426-4733-bd1d-0b6ca087cc0a">AsynchronousCall</a>, using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/005bf0ec-f5a7-41a3-85b3-07f79f26af27">IServiceActivity</a> pointer that was returned from the call to <b>CoCreateActivity</b>.



You must make sure that this method is thread safe in situations where the activity object that is created by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3009eb4f-e3f3-497b-ba05-5b750d8a40d0">CoCreateActivity</a> is not created with a synchronized context because in such situations many calls to <b>OnCall</b> can run at the same time.



To achieve the best performance from the system, the context configuration of the activity created by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3009eb4f-e3f3-497b-ba05-5b750d8a40d0">CoCreateActivity</a> should be matched to the batch work performed by the <b>OnCall</b> method. For example, if the batch work in the <b>OnCall</b> method uses poolable objects, the activity created by <b>CoCreateActivity</b> should be configured to use the multithreaded apartment (MTA).
