# CSC_Binding enumeration


## -description


Indicates whether all of the work that is submitted via the activity returned from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3009eb4f-e3f3-497b-ba05-5b750d8a40d0">CoCreateActivity</a> should be bound to only one single-threaded apartment (STA). This enumeration has no impact on the multithreaded apartment (MTA).


## -enum-fields




### -field CSC_NoBinding

The work submitted through the activity is not bound to a single STA.


### -field CSC_BindToPoolThread

The work submitted through the activity is bound to a single STA.


## -remarks



Binding all of the work submitted through the activity to a single STA involves a trade-off between avoiding the need to marshal interfaces to components used by many of the different bits of work versus needing to synchronize on a specific STA.

This enumeration is used only to set the thread pool binding for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f546ded4-255e-4565-b588-f36175902778">CServiceConfig</a> when calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3009eb4f-e3f3-497b-ba05-5b750d8a40d0">CoCreateActivity</a>. An error is returned if you try to set the thread pool binding when calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/84640b3b-1f43-4bec-abf6-c295cfb3da8b">CoEnterServiceDomain</a>. The values of this enumeration have no impact upon the MTA.
