# ITransactionContext::CreateInstance


## -description


Creates a COM object that can execute within the scope of the transaction that was initiated by the transaction context object.


## -parameters




### -param pszProgId [in]

A reference to the ProgID of the type of object to be instantiated.


### -param pObject [out]

A reference to the new object.


## -returns



This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_UNEXPECTED, E_FAIL, and S_OK.




## -remarks



If the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator is not running and the object is transactional, the object is successfully created. However, method calls to that object will fail with CONTEXT_E_TMNOTAVAILABLE. Objects cannot recover from this condition and should be released.
