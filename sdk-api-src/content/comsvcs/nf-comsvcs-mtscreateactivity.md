# MTSCreateActivity function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>MTSCreateActivity</b> is available for in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3009eb4f-e3f3-497b-ba05-5b750d8a40d0">CoCreateActivity</a> function.]

Creates an activity in a single-threaded apartment to do synchronous or asynchronous batch work.


## -parameters




### -param riid [in]

The ID of the interface to be returned by the <i>ppObj</i> parameter. This parameter should always be IID_IMTSActivity so that a pointer to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a45b29f0-d3f1-4593-9df5-4f6d617b93fa">IMTSActivity</a> is returned.


### -param ppobj [out]

A pointer to the interface of an activity object. The activity object is automatically created by the call to <b>MTSCreateActivity</b>.


## -returns



This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_FAIL, and S_OK.




## -remarks



<b>MTSCreateActivity</b> creates an activity object that is used to submit batch work to the COM+ system. The batch work that is submitted through <b>MTSCreateActivity</b> can be either synchronous or asynchronous and runs in a single-threaded apartment (STA).

<b>MTSCreateActivity</b> returns a pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a45b29f0-d3f1-4593-9df5-4f6d617b93fa">IMTSActivity</a> interface of the object that is created by the call to <b>MTSCreateActivity</b>. By using the methods of <b>IMTSActivity</b>, you determine whether the batch work is done synchronously or asynchronously. The batch work itself is implemented through the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dccf53c3-19d9-435b-91b7-98e41bd48e29">IMTSCall</a> interface.
