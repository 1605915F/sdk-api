# IObjectControl::Activate


## -description


Enables a COM+ object to perform context-specific initialization whenever it is activated. This method is called by the COM+ run-time environment before any other methods are called on the object.



## -parameters






## -returns



This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_UNEXPECTED, E_FAIL, and S_OK.




## -remarks



Whenever a client calls a COM+ object that isn't already active, the COM+ run-time environment automatically activates the object. This is called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/47b23cae-d5fc-4788-ab1c-93d6d8ee3f01">Just-in-Time Activation</a>. For components that support <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cbc63f97-dfc7-4e1f-97f9-2043f8bea1d4">IObjectControl</a> as an interface, COM+ invokes the object's <b>Activate</b> method before passing the client's method call on to the object.

Any context-specific initialization procedures should be implemented in the <b>Activate</b> method for objects that expose <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cbc63f97-dfc7-4e1f-97f9-2043f8bea1d4">IObjectControl</a>.

For example, you can use the <b>Activate</b> method to obtain a reference to an object's context and store it in a member variable. Then the object context is available to any method that requires it, and you do not have to acquire a new one every time you want to use it. After you have a reference to the object's context, you can use the <b>IObjectControl</b> methods to check whether security is enabled, whether the object is executing in a transaction, or whether the caller is in a particular role.

If you are enabling object recycling (by implementing the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/97f585f1-e9c2-4122-a5e9-0a10b874b06e">CanBePooled</a> method to query the object), the <b>Activate</b> method must be able to handle both newly created and recycled objects. When the <b>Activate</b> method returns, there should be no distinguishable difference between a new object and a recycled one.

COM+ expressly forbids calling into an object that exposes <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cbc63f97-dfc7-4e1f-97f9-2043f8bea1d4">IObjectControl</a> before calling the <b>Activate</b> method (when it is in its constructor). Such a call would result in an RPC_E_DISCONNECTED error. For example, if an object passes out a reference to itself while in its constructor and then the reference calls back into that object prior to the call to <b>Activate</b>, the disconnected error is returned.



You can also use the <b>Activate</b> method to obtain a reference to the object's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/116715a5-a3e1-48aa-b155-107ea330b7ee">ISecurityProperty</a> interface and check the security ID of the object's creator before any methods are called.
