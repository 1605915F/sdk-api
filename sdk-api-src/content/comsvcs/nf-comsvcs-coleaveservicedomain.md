# CoLeaveServiceDomain function


## -description


Used to leave code that uses COM+ services.


## -parameters




### -param pUnkStatus [in]

If you want to know the status of the transaction that is completed by the call, this must be a pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface of an object that implements the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/df5eba93-6db7-478c-b6d7-831c20398d66">ITransactionStatus</a> interface. If the enclosed code did not use transactions or if you do not need to know the transaction status, this parameter should be <b>NULL</b>. This parameter is ignored if it is non-<b>NULL</b> and if no transactions were used in the service domain.


## -returns



This function does not return a value.




## -remarks



Code that is enclosed between calls to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/84640b3b-1f43-4bec-abf6-c295cfb3da8b">CoEnterServiceDomain</a> and <b>CoLeaveServiceDomain</b> runs in its own context and behaves as though it were a method that is called from an object created within the context.

<b>CoLeaveServiceDomain</b> triggers the server and then the client side policies as if a method call was returning. The current context is then popped from the context stack, and the context that was running when <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/84640b3b-1f43-4bec-abf6-c295cfb3da8b">CoEnterServiceDomain</a> was called becomes the current context.

Because of their efficient design and because no thread marshaling is involved, using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/84640b3b-1f43-4bec-abf6-c295cfb3da8b">CoEnterServiceDomain</a> and <b>CoLeaveServiceDomain</b> involves significantly reduced overhead as compared to an equivalent method call.


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/84640b3b-1f43-4bec-abf6-c295cfb3da8b">CoEnterServiceDomain</a> and <b>CoLeaveServiceDomain</b> are particularly useful in applications, which can use these functions to access COM+ services without needing to create a component to do so.



The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/84640b3b-1f43-4bec-abf6-c295cfb3da8b">CoEnterServiceDomain</a> and <b>CoLeaveServiceDomain</b> pairs can be nested. It is up to the user to make sure that the pairs of calls are balanced so that every call to <b>CoLeaveServiceDomain</b> matches a previous call to <b>CoEnterServiceDomain</b>.
