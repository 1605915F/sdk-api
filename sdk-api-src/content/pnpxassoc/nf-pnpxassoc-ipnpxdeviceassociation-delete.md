## -remarks



This method modifies the association database entry corresponding to the function instance from which the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/52669dec-2fd7-4f3e-b322-e93d9da5984d">IPNPXDeviceAssociation</a> interface was obtained. 

The following logic is used to determine the callback method used for notification:

<ul>
<li>If a PnP notification is received after the device is deleted, then the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ab4d0fc6-de3f-49cf-b53c-573222a8bc89">IFunctionDiscoveryNotification::OnUpdate</a> method is called  with the <i>enumQueryUpdateAction</i> parameter set to  <b>QUA_REMOVE</b>. </li>
<li>If no PnP notification is received after the device is deleted, and there are no pending PnP events, then the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c4dcc4e9-7acf-44d3-b337-1ac01afa19b0">IFunctionDiscoveryNotification::OnError</a> method is called. </li>
<li>Finally, if no PnP notification is received after the device is deleted, and there are pending PnP events, then no callback method is called.</li>
</ul>
To mark a device as unavailable for use without deleting the association database entry, call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fb420967-c79c-4edd-a432-b982219c0746">IPNPXDeviceAssociation::Unassociate</a>.
