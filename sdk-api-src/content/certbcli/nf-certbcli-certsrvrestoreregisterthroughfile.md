# CertSrvRestoreRegisterThroughFile function


## -description


The <b>CertSrvRestoreRegisterThroughFile</b> function registers a Certificate Services restore.


## -parameters




### -param hbc [in]

A handle to the Certificate Services restore context. This handle is obtained by calling 
the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e607b61c-9636-40e6-abba-74152f37b49e">CertSrvRestorePrepare</a> function.


### -param pwszCheckPointFilePath [in, optional]

A pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string that contains the restore path for the check point file. Pass <b>NULL</b> for this parameter if it is not needed.


### -param pwszLogPath [in, optional]

A pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string that contains the current log file directory. Pass <b>NULL</b> for this parameter if it is not needed.


### -param rgrstmap [in, optional]

An array of <b>CSEDB_RSTMAP</b> structures that contains the restore map. If you are performing a full database restoration, this parameter specifies the name of the backup database, as well as a new name for the database after it is restored. The backup database name is referenced by the <b>pwszDatabaseName</b> member, and the new database name is referenced by the <b>pwszNewDatabaseName</b> member. If the intent is to maintain the same name for both the backup database and the restored database, set both the <b>pwszNewDatabaseName</b> and the <b>pwszDatabaseName</b> members to the same name. The backup database name is constructed from the path returned by the backup client's call to 
the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/02355bd7-6788-4c32-940e-b89e47619aa0">CertSrvRestoreGetDatabaseLocations</a> function. <b>CertSrvRestoreGetDatabaseLocations</b> would have been called during a full backup, and the backup client would have saved the returned path.

If you are performing an incremental restoration, set this parameter to <b>NULL</b>.


### -param crstmap [in]

The number of elements in the <i>rgrstmap</i> array. Set this value to one if a you are performing a full restoration, or zero if you are performing an incremental restoration.


### -param pwszBackupLogPath [in, optional]

A pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string that contains the path for the backup log directory. Pass <b>NULL</b> for this parameter if it is not needed.


### -param genLow [in]

The lowest log number that was restored in this restore session. Log files are in the form of edbXXXXX.log, where XXXXX is a five hexadecimal digit value. For example, edb00001.log is the first log file created by the internal database. For purposes of this function, a value of one in <i>genLow</i> corresponds to the log file edb00001.log.


### -param genHigh [in]

The highest log number that was restored in this restore session.


## -returns



The return value is an <b>HRESULT</b>. A value of <b>S_OK</b> indicates success.




## -remarks



This function is identical to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4549ba26-d52c-4779-b27d-126cef6ef15d">CertSrvRestoreRegister</a> function except that <b>CertSrvRestoreRegister</b> requires the calling account to be a local administrator. The <b>CertSrvRestoreRegisterThroughFile</b> function only requires that the calling account have the restore privilege.
