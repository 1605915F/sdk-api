# TcDeleteFlow function


## -description


The 
<b>TcDeleteFlow</b> function deletes a flow that has been added with the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/20b4f34b-a84e-4211-8d41-0efa0dbc6cd4">TcAddFlow</a> function. Clients should delete all filters associated with a flow before deleting it, otherwise, an error will be returned and the function will not delete the flow.

Traffic control clients that have registered a <b>DeleteFlowComplete</b> handler (a mechanism for allowing traffic control to call the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b31bd6e5-2b72-407d-a77e-ff9cee8de238">ClDeleteFlowComplete</a> callback function to alert clients of completed flow deletions) can expect a return value of ERROR_SIGNAL_PENDING.


## -parameters




### -param FlowHandle [in]

Handle for the flow, as received from a previous call to the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/20b4f34b-a84e-4211-8d41-0efa0dbc6cd4">TcAddFlow</a> function.
