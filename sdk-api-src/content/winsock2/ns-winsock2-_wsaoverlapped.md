# _WSAOVERLAPPED structure


## -description


The 
<b>WSAOVERLAPPED</b> structure provides a communication medium between the initiation of an overlapped I/O operation and its subsequent completion. The 
<b>WSAOVERLAPPED</b> structure is compatible with the Windows 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5037f6b9-e316-483b-a8e2-b58d2587ebd9">OVERLAPPED</a> structure.


## -struct-fields




### -field Internal

Type: <b>ULONG_PTR</b>

Reserved for internal use. The Internal member is used internally by the entity that implements overlapped I/O. For service providers that create sockets as installable file system (IFS) handles, this parameter is used by the underlying operating system. Other service providers (non-IFS providers) are free to use this parameter as necessary.


### -field InternalHigh

Type: <b>ULONG_PTR</b>

Reserved. Used internally by the entity that implements overlapped I/O. For service providers that create sockets as IFS handles, this parameter is used by the underlying operating system. NonIFS providers are free to use this parameter as necessary.


### -field Offset

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Reserved for use by service providers.


### -field OffsetHigh

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Reserved for use by service providers.


### -field hEvent

Type: <b>HANDLE</b>

If an overlapped I/O operation is issued without an I/O completion routine (the operation's <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> parameter is set to null), then this parameter should either contain a valid handle to a WSAEVENT object or be null. If the <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> parameter of the call is non-null then applications are free to use this parameter as necessary.


#### - Pointer

Type: <b>PVOID</b>

Reserved for use by service providers.
