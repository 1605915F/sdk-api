# _AFPROTOCOLS structure


## -description


The 
<b>AFPROTOCOLS</b> structure supplies a list of protocols to which application programmers can constrain queries. The 
<b>AFPROTOCOLS</b> structure is used for query purposes only.


## -struct-fields




### -field iAddressFamily

Address family to which the query is to be constrained.


### -field iProtocol

Protocol to which the query is to be constrained.


## -remarks



The members of the 
<b>AFPROTOCOLS</b> structure are a functional pair, and only have meaning when used together, as protocol values have meaning only within the context of an address family.
