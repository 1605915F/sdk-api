# MFASYNCRESULT structure


## -description


Contains data that is needed to implement the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8c95b1de-8974-445c-8070-41552ea83e53">IMFAsyncResult</a> interface.
        


## -struct-fields




### -field overlapped

An <b>OVERLAPPED</b> structure. This structure is used internally to queue the work item. Fill this member with zeros.
          


### -field pCallback

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7edff985-da59-4cc0-96de-1a92e03a7d41">IMFAsyncCallback</a> interface. This interface is implemented by the caller of the asynchronous method. This member can be <b>NULL</b>. If this member is <b>NULL</b>, the <b>hEvent</b> member must be a valid event handle.
          


### -field hrStatusResult

The status code returned when this structure is used with an I/O completion port. You can also use this member to hold the status code for the asynchronous operation, returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ad99f3dd-4885-42e8-8f4e-060d522dde7b">IMFAsyncResult::GetStatus</a>.
          


### -field dwBytesTransferred

The number of bytes transferred when this structure is used with an I/O completion port. This member is used internally by the work queue. Set this member to zero.
          


### -field hEvent

Event handle. If <b>pCallback</b> is <b>NULL</b>, set this member to a valid event handle. The event is signaled when the work item is dispatched. Otherwise, set this member to <b>NULL</b>.
          


### -field IMFAsyncResult

 




## -remarks



Any custom implementation of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8c95b1de-8974-445c-8070-41552ea83e53">IMFAsyncResult</a> interface must inherit this structure. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/78cef367-b007-46d5-bb7f-2b3f7eed9926">Custom Asynchronous Result Objects</a>.
