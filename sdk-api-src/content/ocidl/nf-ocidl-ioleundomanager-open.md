# IOleUndoManager::Open


## -description


Opens a new parent undo unit, which becomes part of its containing unit's undo stack.


## -parameters




### -param pPUU [in]

An <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4407d673-286a-4221-ae35-09b9865161f8">IOleParentUndoUnit</a> pointer to the parent undo unit to be opened.


## -returns



This method returns S_OK if the parent undo unit was successfully opened or if a currently open unit is blocked. If the undo manager is currently disabled, it will return S_OK and do nothing else.




## -remarks



This method is implemented the same as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/185eae3b-5323-45f1-9810-47bd21ce0d22">IOleParentUndoUnit::Open</a>. The specified parent unit is created and remains open. The undo manager then calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3288e0c6-e345-4c4d-a7bf-0c5f45c19732">IOleUndoManager::Add</a> or <b>IOleUndoManager::Open</b> methods on this parent unit to add new units to it. This parent unit receives any additional undo units until its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4546f270-5cef-42a3-b07a-f0a491e78849">IOleUndoManager::Close</a> method is called.

The parent unit specified by <i>pPUU</i> is not added to the undo stack until its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4546f270-5cef-42a3-b07a-f0a491e78849">IOleUndoManager::Close</a> method is called with the <i>fCommit</i> parameter set to <b>TRUE</b>.

The parent undo unit or undo manager must contain any undo unit given to it unless it is blocked. If it is blocked, it must return S_OK but should do nothing else.
