## -remarks



When an advisory connection is terminated, the connection point calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4b494c6f-f0ee-4c35-ae45-ed956f40dc7a">Release</a> method on the pointer that was saved for the connection during the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/11257f24-096c-4240-8fac-4e42a6161d66">IConnectionPoint::Advise</a> method. This <b>Release</b> reverses the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b4316efd-73d4-4995-b898-8025a316ba63">AddRef</a> that was performed during the <b>Advise</b> when the connection point calls the advisory sink's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/54d5ff80-18db-43f2-b636-f93ac053146d">QueryInterface</a>.
