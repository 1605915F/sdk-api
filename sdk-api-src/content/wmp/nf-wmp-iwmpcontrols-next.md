# IWMPControls::next


## -description



The <b>next</b> method sets the next item in the playlist as the current item.




## -parameters






## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



If the playlist is on the last entry when <b>next</b> is invoked, the first entry in the playlist will become the current one.

For server-side playlists, this method skips to the next item in the server-side playlist, not the client playlist.

When playing a DVD, this method skips to the next logical chapter in the playback sequence, which may not be the next chapter in the playlist. When playing DVD stills, this method skips to the next still.
