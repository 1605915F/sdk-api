After the data is processed, the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) plug-in calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6cb47762-edfc-48d7-88ec-d62056ea1751">WSManPluginOperationComplete</a> to acknowledge receipt and to allow the next object to be delivered.

The DLL entry point name must be <b>WSManPluginSend</b>.
