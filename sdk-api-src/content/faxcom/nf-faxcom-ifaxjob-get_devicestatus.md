# IFaxJob::get_DeviceStatus


## -description


The <b>IFaxJob::get_DeviceStatus</b> property is a null-terminated string that describes the status of the port associated with the fax job.

This property is read-only.


## -parameters


## -remarks



If the job is in the job queue waiting transmission, the fax server has not associated a device with the job. In this instance, <b>IFaxJob::get_DeviceStatus</b> is "Unknown". 

<b>IFaxJob::get_DeviceStatus</b> allocates the memory required for the buffer pointed to by the <i>pVal</i> parameter. The client application must call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms221481(v=VS.85).aspx">SysFreeString</a> function to deallocate the resources associated with this parameter. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms690878(v=VS.85).aspx">Freeing Fax Resources</a>.
