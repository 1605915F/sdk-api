# IFaxServer::put_ArchiveDirectory


## -description


The <b>IFaxServer::get_ArchiveDirectory</b> method retrieves the <b>ArchiveDirectory</b> property for a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e3169385-6a7f-4b2d-ad70-6d4d323becb8">FaxServer</a> object. The <b>ArchiveDirectory</b> property is a null-terminated string that contains the location in which the fax server stores archived outbound faxes.

This property is read/write.


## -parameters


## -remarks



Set the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8cf29336-f41d-4357-a6ea-c0b8ca3344ba">ArchiveOutboundFaxes</a> property to <b>TRUE</b> to archive faxes in the directory specified by the <b>ArchiveDirectory</b> property. The fax server must have access to the directory to successfully store outbound fax transmissions. 
		

The <b>get_ArchiveDirectory</b> method allocates the memory required for the buffer pointed to by the <i>pVal</i> parameter. The client application must call the <a href="8f230ee3-5f6e-4cb9-a910-9c90b754dcd3">SysFreeString</a> function to deallocate the resources associated with this parameter. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a8371d98-8a66-484a-9179-4894ae0a7dfc">Freeing Fax Resources</a>.
