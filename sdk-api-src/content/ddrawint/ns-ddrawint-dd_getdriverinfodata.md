### -field dwExpectedSize

Specifies the number of bytes of data that DirectDraw expects the driver to pass back in the buffer to which <b>lpvData</b> points.


### -field lpvData

Points to a DirectDraw-allocated buffer into which the driver copies the requested data. This buffer is typically <b>dwExpectedSize</b> bytes in size. The driver must not write more than <b>dwExpectedSize</b> bytes of data in it. The driver specifies the number of bytes that it writes to this buffer in the <b>dwActualSize</b> member. 


### -field dwActualSize

Specifies the location in which the driver returns the number of bytes of data it writes in <b>lpvData</b>. 


### -field ddRVal

Specifies the location in which the driver writes the return value of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/89a22163-a678-4c72-932a-ae4d17922e0b">DdGetDriverInfo</a> callback. A return code of DD_OK indicates success. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/da4cc7d7-6826-48aa-96c6-004e31fc3e3e">Return Values for DirectDraw</a>.


## -remarks



The data structure passed to the driver for a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/89a22163-a678-4c72-932a-ae4d17922e0b">DdGetDriverInfo</a> call has minor differences between Windows 98/Me and Windows 2000 and later. On Windows 2000 and later the data structure is called DD_GETDRIVERINFODATA and on Windows 98/Me the data structure is called DDHAL_GETDRIVERINFODATA. Both data structures include a field for driver specific context information. On Windows 2000 and later, DD_GETDRIVERINFODATA includes a field <b>dhpdev</b> that stores the DHPDEV of the driver being called. Only on Windows 98/Me, DDHAL_GETDRIVERINFODATA includes a field <b>dwContext</b> that is copied for the driver reserved <b>dwReserved3</b> field of the DirectDraw global object.
