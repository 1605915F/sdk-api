# PDD_SURFCB_DESTROYSURFACE callback function


## -description


The <b>DdDestroySurface</b> callback function destroys a DirectDraw surface.


## -parameters




### -param Arg1








#### - lpDestroySurface

Points to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/77d9544d-72df-4e7d-ba57-644aeee34a88">DD_DESTROYSURFACEDATA</a> structure that contains the information needed to destroy a surface.


## -returns



<b>DdDestroySurface</b> returns one of the following callback codes:




## -remarks



If DirectDraw did the memory allocation at surface creation time and the driver was not involved in the allocation, DirectDraw does not call the driver's <b>DdDestroySurface</b> function to destroy the surface. 

If the driver is performing the surface memory management itself, <b>DdDestroySurface</b> should free the surface memory and perform any other cleanup, such as freeing private data stored in the <b>dwReserved1</b> members of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/11e0a6b9-16b9-4fc3-8e17-776f56c12196">DD_SURFACE_GLOBAL</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/45a41cec-0257-4e26-809d-c2fc4c247328">DD_SURFACE_LOCAL</a> structures.

For a driver-managed surface, if the surface is persistent (that is, the DDSCAPS2_DONOTPERSIST flag in the <b>dwCaps2</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/023b1a6d-3f08-43cc-b9c0-9d312b347a6b">DDSCAPS2</a> structure for the surface is not set), <b>DdDestroySurface</b> can be called with the purpose of envicting the surface from video memory. In this case, the display driver can continue to keep any private data in the <b>dwReserved1</b> members until <b>DdDestroySurface</b> is called to actually destroy the surface.

<b>DdDestroySurface</b> can be called with a disabled <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/139a10e9-203b-499b-9291-8537eae9189c">PDEV</a>. PDEV is disabled or enabled by calling the display driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/29846ffd-b721-4d61-9983-07a2575f9fe8">DrvAssertMode</a> function. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f7badbe8-b24f-438a-8937-95bb98de6310">Managing PDEVs</a> for more information.
