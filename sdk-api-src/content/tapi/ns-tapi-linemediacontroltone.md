# LINEMEDIACONTROLTONE structure


## -description


The 
<b>LINEMEDIACONTROLTONE</b> structure describes a media action to be executed when a tone has been detected. It is used as an entry in an array. The 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5a4fc83a-6bc9-4081-b374-ddb912fb2242">lineSetMediaControl</a> and 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e9273bd6-8dc3-4b45-bf0e-a1a10d78a604">TSPI_lineSetMediaControl</a> functions use this structure.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwAppSpecific

Used by the application for tagging the tone. When this tone is detected, the value of the <b>dwAppSpecific</b> member is passed back to the application.


### -field dwDuration

Duration of time during which the tone should be present before a detection is made, in milliseconds.


### -field dwFrequency1

First frequency of the tone, in hertz.


### -field dwFrequency2

Second frequency of the tone, in hertz.


### -field dwFrequency3

Third frequency of the tone, in hertz. If fewer than three frequencies are needed in the tone, a value of 0 should be used for the unused frequencies. A tone with all three frequencies set to zero is interpreted as silence and can be use for silence detection.


### -field dwMediaControl

Media control action. This member uses one of the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1e8aeda8-2810-462a-bfba-0296d854d9aa">LINEMEDIACONTROL_ Constants</a>.


## -remarks



This structure may not be extended.

The 
<b>LINEMEDIACONTROLTONE</b> structure defines a tuple &lt;tone, media-control action&gt;. An array of these tuples is passed to the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5a4fc83a-6bc9-4081-b374-ddb912fb2242">lineSetMediaControl</a> function to set media control actions triggered by media type changes for a given call. When a change to a listed media type is detected, the corresponding action on the media stream is invoked.

A tone with all frequencies set to zero corresponds to silence. An application can thus monitor the call's information stream for silence.
