<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/83e38453-bb93-4cc5-923f-d0cd2898350a">LINEDEVCAPS</a> may be available.


## -remarks



Device-specific extensions should use the <b>DevSpecific</b> (<b>dwDevSpecificSize</b> and <b>dwDevSpecificOffset</b>) variably sized area of this data structure.

Older applications are compiled without this member in the 
<b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b> structure, and using a SIZEOF(LINEADDRESSCAPS) smaller than the new size. The application passes in a <i>dwAPIVersion</i> parameter with the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/08cdea8a-5b36-428c-b90f-8741ae5f3205">lineGetAddressCaps</a> function, which can be used for guidance by TAPI in handling this situation. If the application passes in a <b>dwTotalSize</b> member less than the size of the fixed portion of the structure as defined in the <b>dwAPIVersion</b> member specified, LINEERR_STRUCTURETOOSMALL is returned. If sufficient memory has been allocated by the application, before calling 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b8d52a94-2666-4f92-80e0-c9a1e04d1e79">TSPI_lineGetAddressCaps</a>, TAPI sets the <b>dwNeededSize</b> and <b>dwUsedSize</b> members to the fixed size of the structure as it existed in the specified API version.

New service providers (that support the new API version) must examine the API version passed in. If the API version is less than the highest version supported by the provider, the service provider must not fill in fields not supported in older API versions, as these would fall in the variable portion of the older structure.

New applications must be cognizant of the API version negotiated, and not examine the contents of fields in the fixed portion beyond the original end of the fixed portion of the structure for the negotiated API version. 

The members <b>dwPredictiveAutoTransferStates</b> through <b>dwAvailableMediaModes</b> are available only to applications that request an API version of 2.0 or later when calling 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/08cdea8a-5b36-428c-b90f-8741ae5f3205">lineGetAddressCaps</a>.
