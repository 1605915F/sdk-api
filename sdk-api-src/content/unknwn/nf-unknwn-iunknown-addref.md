# IUnknown::AddRef


## -description


Increments the reference count for an interface on an object. This method should be called for every new copy of a pointer to an interface on an object.


## -parameters






## -returns



The method returns the new reference count. This value is intended to be used only for test purposes.




## -remarks



Objects use a reference counting mechanism to ensure that the lifetime of the object includes the lifetime of references to it. You use <b>AddRef</b> to stabilize a copy of an interface pointer. It can also be called when the life of a cloned pointer must extend beyond the lifetime of the original pointer. The cloned pointer must be released by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4b494c6f-f0ee-4c35-ae45-ed956f40dc7a">IUnknown::Release</a>.

The internal reference counter that <b>AddRef</b> maintains should be a 32-bit unsigned integer.

Call this method for every new copy of an interface pointer that you make. For example, if you are passing a copy of a pointer back from a method, you must call <b>AddRef</b> on that pointer. You must also call <b>AddRef</b> on a pointer before passing it as an in-out parameter to a method; the method will call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4b494c6f-f0ee-4c35-ae45-ed956f40dc7a">IUnknown::Release</a> before copying the out-value on top of it.
