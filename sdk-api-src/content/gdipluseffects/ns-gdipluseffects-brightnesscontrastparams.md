# BrightnessContrastParams structure


## -description


A <b>BrightnessContrastParams</b> structure contains members that specify the nature of a brightness or contrast adjustment.

You can change the brightness or contrast (or both) of a bitmap by following these steps.
<ol>
<li>Create and initialize a <b>BrightnessContrastParams</b> structure.</li>
<li>Pass the address of the <b>BrightnessContrastParams</b> structure to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536278(v=VS.85).aspx">BrightnessContrast::SetParameters</a> method of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534423(v=VS.85).aspx">BrightnessContrast</a> object.</li>
<li>Pass the address of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534423(v=VS.85).aspx">BrightnessContrast</a> object to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536058(v=VS.85).aspx">Graphics::DrawImage</a> method or to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536284(v=VS.85).aspx">Bitmap::ApplyEffect</a> method.</li>
</ol>

## -struct-fields




### -field brightnessLevel

Type: <b>INT</b>

Integer in the range -255 through 255 that specifies the brightness level. If the value is 0, the brightness remains the same. As the value moves from 0 to 255, the brightness of the image increases. As the value moves from 0 to -255, the brightness of the image decreases.


### -field contrastLevel

Type: <b>INT</b>

Integer in the range -100 through 100 that specifies the contrast level. If the value is 0, the contrast remains the same. As the value moves from 0 to 100, the contrast of the image increases. As the value moves from 0 to -100, the contrast of the image decreases.
