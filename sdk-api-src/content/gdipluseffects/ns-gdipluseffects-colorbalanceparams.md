# ColorBalanceParams structure


## -description


A <b>ColorBalanceParams</b> structure contains members that specify the nature of a color balance adjustment.

You can change the color balance of a bitmap by following these steps.
<ol>
<li>Create and initialize a <b>ColorBalanceParams</b> structure.</li>
<li>Pass the address of the <b>ColorBalanceParams</b> structure to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536264(v=VS.85).aspx">ColorBalance::SetParameters</a> method of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534428(v=VS.85).aspx">ColorBalance</a> object.</li>
<li>Pass the address of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534428(v=VS.85).aspx">ColorBalance</a> object to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536058(v=VS.85).aspx">Graphics::DrawImage</a> method or to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536284(v=VS.85).aspx">Bitmap::ApplyEffect</a> method.</li>

## -struct-fields




### -field cyanRed

Type: <b>INT</b>

Integer in the range -100 through 100 that specifies a change in the amount of red in the image. If the value is 0, there is no change. As the value moves from 0 to 100, the amount of red in the image increases and the amount of cyan decreases. As the value moves from 0 to -100, the amount of red in the image decreases and the amount of cyan increases.


### -field magentaGreen

Type: <b>INT</b>

Integer in the range -100 through 100 that specifies a change in the amount of green in the image. If the value is 0, there is no change. As the value moves from 0 to 100, the amount of green in the image increases and the amount of magenta decreases. As the value moves from 0 to -100, the amount of green in the image decreases and the amount of magenta increases.


### -field yellowBlue

Type: <b>INT</b>

Integer in the range -100 through 100 that specifies a change in the amount of blue in the image. If the value is 0, there is no change. As the value moves from 0 to 100, the amount of blue in the image increases and the amount of yellow decreases. As the value moves from 0 to -100, the amount of blue in the image decreases and the amount of yellow increases.
