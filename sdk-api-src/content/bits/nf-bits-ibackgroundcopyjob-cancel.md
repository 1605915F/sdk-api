## -remarks



You can 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8f96ed59-b038-4047-bea4-c63b9e84c209">cancel a job</a> at any time; however, the job cannot be recovered after it is canceled.

For upload jobs, if the server is unavailable, there may be a delay before BITS deletes the job from the queue. BITS periodically sends a cancel request to the BITS server for up to 24 hours. If the server does not respond within the 24-hour period, BITS removes the job from the queue. If the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3fcf46ed-197f-46ad-ac62-2c4a2e8b27ef">no-progress time-out period</a> is less than 24 hours, BITS uses the no-progress time-out period to limit the retries.

The 
<b>Cancel</b> method cancels an upload if the upload is not complete. If the upload is complete and the job is of type BG_JOB_TYPE_UPLOAD_REPLY, the method cancels the reply.
