# DataFlow enumeration


## -description



The <b>DataFlow</b> enumeration indicates the data-flow direction of an audio stream through a connector.




## -enum-fields




### -field In

Input stream. The audio stream flows into the device through the connector.


### -field Out

Output stream. The audio stream flows out of the device through the connector.


## -remarks



The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/55078775-2921-45c2-af27-c8ad53688293">IConnector::GetDataFlow</a> method uses the constants defined in the <b>DataFlow</b> enumeration.

The topology of a rendering or capture device on an audio adapter typically has one or more connectors with a data-flow direction of "In" through which audio data enters the device, and one or more connectors with a data-flow direction of "Out" through which audio data exits the device. For example, a typical rendering device on an adapter has a connector with data-flow direction "In" through which the Windows audio engine streams PCM data into the device. The same device has a connector with data-flow direction "Out" through which the device transmits an audio signal to speakers or headphones.

The topology of a rendering endpoint device (for example, headphones) has a single connector with data-flow direction "In" through which audio data (in the form of an analog signal) enters the device.

The topology of a capture endpoint device (for example, a microphone) has a single connector with data-flow direction "Out" through which audio data exits the device.
