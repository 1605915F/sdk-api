# DXGI_QUERY_VIDEO_MEMORY_INFO structure


## -description


Describes the current video memory budgeting parameters.


## -struct-fields




### -field Budget

Specifies the OS-provided video memory budget, in bytes, that the application should target. If <i>CurrentUsage</i> is greater than <i>Budget</i>, the application may incur stuttering or performance penalties due to background activity by the OS to provide other applications with a fair usage of video memory.


### -field CurrentUsage

              Specifies the application’s current video memory usage, in bytes.


### -field AvailableForReservation

              The amount of video memory, in bytes, that the application has available for reservation. To reserve this video memory, the application should call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5D17F57F-9FFA-4B5C-98B6-33E5B3982A63">IDXGIAdapter3::SetVideoMemoryReservation</a>.


### -field CurrentReservation

              The amount of video memory, in bytes, that is reserved by the application. The OS uses the reservation as a hint to determine the application’s minimum working set. Applications should attempt to ensure that their video memory usage can be trimmed to meet this requirement.




## -remarks



Use this structure with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/A2F95FE5-CF8D-4F17-8CC8-62AAA40B71FC">QueryVideoMemoryInfo</a>.
