## -remarks



This operation is called by various methods to indicate that an operation is beginning. The number of ticks passed in <i>dwEstimatedTicks</i> is an estimate of how many ticks are needed for the operation to complete. During the course of the operation, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e85b6b46-2c42-461f-90b5-71b48bc4a111">Progress</a> method is called to indicate how many ticks have transpired. Applications can use the estimate to configure display mechanisms that show progress.

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8c794aff-9800-405e-853a-56dd5bd84665">IWMDMProgress3::Begin3</a> method provides more information about what action is occurring.


#### Examples

The following C++ code is an implementation of the <b>Begin</b> method.


```cpp

HRESULT Begin(DWORD  dwEstimatedTicks)
{
    // TODO: Display the message: "IWMDMProgress::Begin called.: "
    // followed by the dwEstimatedTicks value.
    return S_OK;
}

```
