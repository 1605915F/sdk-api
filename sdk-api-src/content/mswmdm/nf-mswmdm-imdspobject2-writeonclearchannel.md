# IMDSPObject2::WriteOnClearChannel


## -description



The <b>WriteOnClearChannel</b> method writes data to the object to the current position within the object, without using secure authenticated channels. This operation is valid only if the storage object represents a file. If <b>IMDSPObject2</b> is supported, this method must be implemented. Windows Media Device Manager does not fall back to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/29f16be5-9304-4b09-86e8-3f9e0e591a41">IMDSPObject::Write</a> if this method fails.




## -parameters




### -param pData [in]

Pointer to the buffer containing the data to write to the object.


### -param pdwSize [in, out]

Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> containing the number of bytes of data to write. Upon return, this parameter contains the actual number of bytes written.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. All the interface methods in Windows Media Device Manager can return any of the following classes of error codes:

<ul>
<li>Standard COM error codes </li>
<li>Windows error codes converted to HRESULT values </li>
<li>Windows Media Device Manager error codes </li>
</ul>
For an extensive list of possible error codes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/37e4ad70-afe9-40d6-8c4b-e5fcaa8db4ad">Error Codes</a>.




## -remarks



This method can be used with DRM-protected content. It is more efficient than <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/29f16be5-9304-4b09-86e8-3f9e0e591a41">IMDSPObject::Write</a> because this method does not involve encrypting and decrypting parameters.

Unlike <b>IMDSPObject::Write</b>, this method does not need to decrypt the data before writing to a device, and is therefore more efficient.
