## -remarks



This method is used to invoke both device playback (playback of an audio track on a storage medium of the media device) and streaming audio playback (streaming audio data from the user's computer to the media device, where it is played). The <b>Seek</b> method determines the form of playback that occurs.

Some devices do not support either device playback or streaming audio playback. Before attempting to start playback of a particular type, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5d4e433a-fb2a-43c4-ab7f-fb7168636455">GetCapabilities</a> method must be called. If unsupported playback is attempted, this method returns WMDM_E_NOTSUPPORTED.

To determine whether an audio format can be played by the media device before invoking the play operation, you can call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ac50ac7d-bd55-4ece-8af8-5c8b2f7736e8">IMDSPDevice::GetFormatSupport</a> method.
