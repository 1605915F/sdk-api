# IWMDMObjectInfo::GetPlayLength


## -description



The <b>GetPlayLength</b> method retrieves the play length of the object in units appropriate to the format. This is the remaining length that the file can play, not its total length.




## -parameters




### -param pdwLength [out]

Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> specifying the remaining play length of the file, in milliseconds.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. All the interface methods in Windows Media Device Manager can return any of the following classes of error codes:

<ul>
<li>Standard COM error codes </li>
<li>Windows error codes converted to HRESULT values </li>
<li>Windows Media Device Manager error codes </li>
</ul>
For an extensive list of possible error codes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/37e4ad70-afe9-40d6-8c4b-e5fcaa8db4ad">Error Codes</a>.




## -remarks



The value of the play length retrieved is either the total length of the object minus the current play position (if the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7dfa6443-4eb8-4a88-8af1-c082750e8d22">SetPlayLength</a> method has not been called), or the value set by <b>SetPlayLength</b> clipped to be no greater than the total play length of the object minus the current play position.

The play length information can change either when the user starts playing a file on the media device or when an application invokes the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e8d717e6-365c-44ad-b24e-daa3c35664de">Play</a> method.

For folders or file systems containing playable files, the value returned is in tracks or numbers of playable files in that folder or in the root of that file system.
