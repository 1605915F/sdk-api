For the user to receive visual notification of a change in the SoH, the callback must remain in place until after authentication is complete.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Never cancel the callback while re-authentication is in progress and the network connection is still valid. Never attempt to use any other mechanism to notify the supplicant that the SoH has changed.  </div><div> </div>
