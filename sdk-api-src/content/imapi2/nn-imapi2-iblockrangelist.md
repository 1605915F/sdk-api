## -description


Use this interface to retrieve a list of continuous sector ranges on the media. This interface is used to describe the sectors that need to be updated on a rewritable disc when a new logical session is recorded.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IBlockRangeList</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms221608(v=VS.85).aspx">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>IBlockRangeList</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IBlockRangeList</b> interface has these methods.
<table class="members" id="memberListMethods">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="37%">Method</th>
<th align="left" width="63%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr data="declared;">
<td align="left" width="37%"><b>get_BlockRanges</b></td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Retrieves a safe array of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/abebc651-0575-4b76-9fe8-2cea3d617582">IBlockRange</a> interfaces describing the sector ranges in the list.

## -remarks



<b>IBlockRangeList</b> is returned by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2148ba3f-f334-43cb-965a-37b078419e0c">IFileSystemImageResult2::ModifiedBlocks</a> method. Alternatively, IUnknown::QueryInterface can be called on the object returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/87e4bde6-c8c3-43b6-b096-514fdef5e262">IFileSystemImageResult::get_ImageStream</a> to get the list of modified sectors in the result image represented by that object.

The order of sector ranges in <b>IBlockRangeList</b> is taken into account during burning. The sector ranges having lower indexes in the safe array returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b9c7e4ee-0fb2-4a15-8277-8db82a4f3afe">IBlockRangeList::get_BlockRanges</a> are written before those with higher indexes.
