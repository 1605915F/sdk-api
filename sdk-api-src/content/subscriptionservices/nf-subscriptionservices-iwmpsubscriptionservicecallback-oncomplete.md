## -remarks




<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/64ab5548-b562-44e4-9798-8f14d3ed653b">IWMPSubscriptionService2::prepareForSync</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3450e57-5e25-411c-8b21-b687021a6500">IWMPSubscriptionService2::deviceAvailable</a> supply a pointer to an <b>IWMPSubscriptionServiceCallback</b> interface. When responding to calls from Windows Media Player to these methods, you must pass any time-consuming tasks to a separate worker thread and return immediately. When the worker thread has completed its task, it must call <b>IWMPSubscriptionServiceCallback::onComplete</b>.

In your <b>prepareForSync</b> and <b>deviceAvailable</b> methods, use the following procedure to provide your worker thread with a pointer to an <b>IWMPSubscriptionServiceCallback</b> interface.

<ol>
<li>Pass the pointer supplied in the <i>pCB</i> parameter to <b>CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream</b>, which returns an <b>IStream</b> pointer.</li>
<li>Pass the <b>IStream</b> pointer to your worker thread.</li>
<li>In your worker thread, call <b>CoGetInterfaceAndReleaseStream</b>, which returns an interface pointer that you can use to call <b>onComplete</b>.</li>
</ol>
