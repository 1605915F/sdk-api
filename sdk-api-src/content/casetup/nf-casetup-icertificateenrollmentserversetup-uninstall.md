## -remarks



You can call this method to remove CES. However, because you cannot call the <b>UnInstall</b> method on an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B25DA7C4-0503-4E3B-BABC-6EFBD9EBDDAE">ICertificateEnrollmentServerSetup</a> object that has already been initialized, you must create a new <b>ICertificateEnrollmentServerSetup</b> before calling <b>UnInstall</b>.

This method attempts to delete all CES-related  directories and the application pool. If it is unable to do so, it still returns S_OK, but you can check the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/D4322BE8-1CED-47D0-98C2-D5D7C151DEAB">ErrorString</a> property to determine what problems the method encountered.

This function performs the following actions:

<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Attempts to delete the %windir%\systemdata\ces directory and all application subdirectories that may exist. For more information, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/35578035-1D09-48AD-B6F5-7314C989B519">Install</a> Remarks section.

</li>
<li>
Attempts to delete the application pool and all applications in the pool.

</li>
<li>
Attempts to update the security descriptor of the Deleted Objects container in Active Directory to deny access by the computer. For more information, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/35578035-1D09-48AD-B6F5-7314C989B519">Install</a> Remarks section.
