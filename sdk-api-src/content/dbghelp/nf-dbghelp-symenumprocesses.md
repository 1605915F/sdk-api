### -param EnumProcessesCallback [in]

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4748b2a3-0b7b-4d9c-96ed-c4b3ba927107">SymEnumProcessesProc</a> callback function that receives the process information.


### -param UserContext [in]

A user-defined value that is passed to the callback function, or <b>NULL</b>. This parameter is typically used by an application to pass a pointer to a data structure that provides context for the callback function.


## -returns

If the function fails, the return value is <b>FALSE</b>. To retrieve extended error information, call 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d852e148-985c-416f-a5a7-27b6914b45d4">GetLastError</a>.




## -remarks



All DbgHelp functions, such as this one, are single threaded. Therefore, calls from more than one thread to this function will likely result in unexpected behavior or memory corruption. To avoid this, you must synchronize all concurrent calls from more than one thread to this function.
