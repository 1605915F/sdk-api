# ICallFrameEvents::OnCall


## -description


Informs the event sink if it receives a method call on the interceptor. The sink is provided with an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/56a75123-f402-4187-af13-d31f72a5f094">ICallFrame</a> instance which is bound to the intercepted incoming method invocation. Through that sink the call frame can be manipulated in various ways.


## -parameters




### -param pFrame [in]

A call frame bound to the just-received invocation.


## -returns



This method can return the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_UNEXPECTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An unexpected error has occurred.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



On return from <b>OnCall</b>, the interceptor assumes that by some means the out-values of the method have been appropriately initialized as needed, if any; the interceptor does not itself manipulate the call frame further in any way. Typically, the <b>OnCall</b> implementation will have set the out-values by some means, either by invoking the call frame on an object, successfully unmarshalling some previously marshaled out-values, or clearing them with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/97261d93-40cf-4a27-9bee-677600c04699">ICallFrame::Free</a>.

The return value should also have been appropriately set during the call in a similar manner. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/848cccc7-19c8-4ce6-b609-bcf798ec8c76">ICallFrame::SetReturnValue</a>.
