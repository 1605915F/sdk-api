# ICallFrame::ReleaseMarshalData


## -description


Releases resources that are held by interface pointers residing in a packet of marshaled data. This method finds all interface pointers in the packet, and calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a642a20f-3a3c-46bc-b833-e424dab3a16d">CoReleaseMarshalData</a> function on each one.



## -parameters




### -param pBuffer [in]

A pointer to the buffer containing the marshaled [out] values.


### -param cbBuffer [in]

The size of the buffer, in bytes.


### -param ibFirstRelease [in]

The first byte in the buffer, which is to be released. A value of zero implies that the interface pointers in the whole buffer are to be released. The marshaled interface pointers are assumed to have been released by some other mechanism.


### -param dataRep [in]

The data representation with which the data was marshaled.


### -param pcontext [in]

A pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4ecc4646-db3f-4d0e-9c45-b78a288156e1">CALLFRAME_MARSHALCONTEXT</a> structure containing context information about how un-marshalling is carried out.


## -returns



This method can return the following values.

## -remarks



The <b>ReleaseMarshalData</b> method must be called exactly once to clean up the resources held in a marshaled buffer. However when the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/42a482be-d4b8-4f2e-ae43-1d210cb44c7c">MSHLFLAGS</a> enumeration is set to MSHLFLAGS_NORMAL, this is done automatically during un-marshaling and so need not be carried out explicitly.

This method can function correctly on both marshaled [in] and [out] parameters.
