# ICEnroll::getCertFromPKCS7


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This method is no longer available for use as of Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.]

The <b>getCertFromPKCS7</b> method retrieves the certificate, contained in a PKCS #7 message, that was  issued in response to a PKCS #10 certificate request. This method was first defined by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d5b746e0-91bd-45bd-9a67-ddc8868cee56">ICEnroll</a> interface.

This method retrieves the single certificate that was issued even though a PKCS #7 message may contain many certificates that specify the certification chain of authority that issued the certificate.


## -parameters




### -param wszPKCS7 [in]

Specifies the PKCS #7 from which the issued certificate is being retrieved.


### -param pbstrCert [out]

A pointer to a <b>BSTR</b> variable to receive the issued certificate. When you have finished using the <b>BSTR</b>, free it by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms221481(v=VS.85).aspx">SysFreeString</a> function.


## -returns



<h3>C++</h3>
 If the method succeeds, the method returns S_OK.

If the method fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ce52efc3-92c7-40e4-ac49-0c54049e169f">Common HRESULT Values</a>.

<h3>VB</h3>
 The string that contains the issued certificate.
