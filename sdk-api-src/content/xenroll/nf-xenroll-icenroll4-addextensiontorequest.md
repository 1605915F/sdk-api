# ICEnroll4::addExtensionToRequest


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This method is no longer available for use as of Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.]

The <b>addExtensionToRequest</b> method adds an extension to the request. This method was first defined in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4e3e3792-aa41-46fe-bf75-26c2b8959f7a">ICEnroll4</a> interface.


## -parameters




### -param Flags [in]

Specifies whether the extension is critical. 
If <b>TRUE</b>, the extension being added is critical. If <b>FALSE</b>, it is not critical.

Note that <b>TRUE</b> is defined (in a Microsoft header file) for C/C++ programmers as one, while  Visual Basic defines the <b>True</b> keyword as negative one. As a result, Visual Basic developers must use one (instead of <b>True</b>) to set this parameter to <b>TRUE</b>. However, to set this parameter to <b>FALSE</b>, Visual Basic developers can use zero or <b>False</b>.


### -param strName [in]

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e6be8932-015e-4058-b249-1671b3fea521">object identifier</a> (OID) that represents the extension name.


### -param strValue [in]

The base64-encoded or binary extension value.


## -returns



<h3>VB</h3>
The return value is an <b>HRESULT</b>, with <b>S_OK</b> returned if the call is successful.
