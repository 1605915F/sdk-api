# PathCchAddBackslashEx function


## -description



Adds a backslash to the end of a string to create the correct syntax for a path. If the source path already has a trailing backslash, no backslash will be added.

This function differs from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b50677cd-8815-4d84-b70a-c83863378c56">PathCchAddBackslash</a> in that it can return a pointer to the new end of the string and report the number of unused characters remaining in the buffer.

This function differs from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/27d8aec7-8b00-412a-9a42-8ce27e262781">PathAddBackslash</a> in that it accepts paths with "\\", "\\?\" and "\\?\UNC\" prefixes.
