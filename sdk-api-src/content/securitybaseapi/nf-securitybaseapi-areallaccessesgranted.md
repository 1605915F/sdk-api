# AreAllAccessesGranted function


## -description


The <b>AreAllAccessesGranted</b> function checks whether a set of requested access rights has been granted. The access rights are represented as bit flags in an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0baaa937-f635-4500-8dcd-9dbbd6f4cd02">access mask</a>.


## -parameters




### -param GrantedAccess [in]

An access mask that specifies the access rights that have been granted.


### -param DesiredAccess [in]

An access mask that specifies the access rights that have been requested. This mask must have been mapped from generic to specific and standard access rights, usually by calling the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/54b5cd73-4011-4dcf-a951-7350dbd6eeab">MapGenericMask</a> function.


## -returns



If all requested access rights have been granted, the return value is nonzero.

If not all requested access rights have been granted, the return value is zero.




## -remarks



The <b>AreAllAccessesGranted</b> function is commonly used by a server application to check the access rights of a client attempting to gain access to an object. When the bits set in the <i>DesiredAccess</i> parameter match the bits set in the <i>GrantedAccess</i> parameter, all requested rights have been granted.
