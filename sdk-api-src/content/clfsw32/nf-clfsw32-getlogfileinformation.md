# GetLogFileInformation function


## -description


Returns a buffer that contains metadata about a specified log and its current state, which is defined by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/06f5919e-b98f-4502-9653-9ef42c1ebe5a">CLFS_INFORMATION</a> structure.

Data that is obtained  reflects the state of the log only at the time when the call is made. Typically, a client can continue to cache and use fields from this structure until the next time that it appends records or writes its restart area. At that time, some of the information becomes stale.


## -parameters




### -param hLog [in]

A handle to an open log that is obtained from a successful call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ac104bf9-7ca7-417a-bd14-09b0e82c6a77">CreateLogFile</a>.  

The log handle can refer to a dedicated or multiplexed log.


### -param pinfoBuffer [in, out]

A pointer to a user-allocated <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/06f5919e-b98f-4502-9653-9ef42c1ebe5a">CLFS_INFORMATION</a> structure that receives the log metadata.


### -param cbBuffer [in, out]

A pointer to a variable that on input specifies the size, in bytes, of the metadata buffer pointed to by <i>pinfoBuffer</i>.

 On output, it specifies the number of bytes that are actually copied into <i>pinfoBuffer</i>.
