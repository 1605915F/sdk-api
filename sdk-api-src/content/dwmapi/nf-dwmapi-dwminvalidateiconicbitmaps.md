# DwmInvalidateIconicBitmaps function


## -description


Called by an application to indicate that all previously provided iconic bitmaps from a window, both thumbnails and peek representations, should be refreshed.


## -parameters




### -param hwnd [in]

A handle to the window or tab whose bitmaps are being invalidated through this call. This window must belong to the calling process.


## -returns



If this function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



Calling this function causes the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) to invalidate its current bitmaps for the window and request new bitmaps from the window when they are next needed. <b>DwmInvalidateIconicBitmaps</b> should not be called frequently. Doing so can lead to poor performance as new bitmaps are created and retrieved.
