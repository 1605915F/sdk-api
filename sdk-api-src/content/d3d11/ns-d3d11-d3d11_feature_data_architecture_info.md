## -description

## -struct-fields




### -field TileBasedDeferredRenderer

Specifies whether a rendering device batches rendering commands and performs multipass rendering into tiles or bins over a render area. Certain API usage patterns that are fine for TileBasedDefferredRenderers (TBDRs) can perform worse on non-TBDRs and vice versa.  Applications that are careful about rendering can be friendly to both TBDR and non-TBDR architectures. <b>TRUE</b> if the rendering device batches rendering commands and <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.
