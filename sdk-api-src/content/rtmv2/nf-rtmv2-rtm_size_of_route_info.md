# RTM_SIZE_OF_ROUTE_INFO macro


## -description


The 
<b>RTM_SIZE_OF_ROUTE_INFO</b> macro returns the size of the route information structure, 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7d9bf8c0-dc09-440a-b60d-97463c70a745">RTM_ROUTE_INFO</a>. The size of this structure is variable, and is based on the number of next hops associated with the route. Use this macro when allocating memory for route structures.


## -parameters




### -param NumHops

Specifies the number of next hops in the route structure.


## -remarks



If the client  only allocates one next hop per route, the client can allocate an 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7d9bf8c0-dc09-440a-b60d-97463c70a745">RTM_ROUTE_INFO</a> structure statically.

The macro is defined as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage="ManagedCPlusPlus"><table>
<tr>
<th>C++</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

#define RTM_SIZE_OF_ROUTE_INFO(NumHops)                     \
    FIELD_OFFSET(RTM_ROUTE_INFO, NextHopsList.NumNextHops)

#define RTM_BASIC_ROUTE_INFO_SIZE                           \
    (RTM_BASIC_ROUTE_INFO_SIZE + (NumHops) *                \
     sizeof(RTM_NEXTHOP_HANDLE))
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
