# IDXGIDevice2::OfferResources


## -description


Allows the operating system to free the video memory of resources by discarding their content.


## -parameters




### -param NumResources [in]

The number of resources in the <i>ppResources</i> argument array.


### -param ppResources [in]

An array of pointers to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Bb174560(v=VS.85).aspx">IDXGIResource</a> interfaces for the resources to offer.


### -param Priority [in]

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/BDC0AAA3-2B72-4732-82CE-458C14B0D993">DXGI_OFFER_RESOURCE_PRIORITY</a>-typed value that indicates how valuable data is.


## -returns



<b>OfferResources</b> returns:
            
          

<ul>
<li>S_OK if resources were successfully offered</li>
<li>E_INVALIDARG if a resource in the array or the priority is invalid</li>
</ul>



## -remarks



The priority value that the  <i>Priority</i> parameter specifies describes how valuable the caller considers the content to be.  The operating system uses the priority value to discard resources in order of priority. The operating system discards a resource that is offered with low priority before it discards a resource that is  offered with a higher priority.

If you call <b>OfferResources</b> to offer a resource while the resource is bound to the pipeline, the resource is unbound.  You cannot call <b>OfferResources</b> on a resource that is mapped.  After you offer a resource, the resource cannot be mapped or bound to the pipeline until you call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/30533605-0F5A-4D15-B01E-7C23E2AE775E">IDXGIDevice2::ReclaimResource</a> method to reclaim the resource. You cannot call <b>OfferResources</b> to offer immutable resources.

To offer shared resources, call <b>OfferResources</b> on only one of the sharing devices.  To ensure exclusive access to the resources, you must use an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f790eb46-f116-4258-8c8d-de1ece4a1f21">IDXGIKeyedMutex</a> object and then call <b>OfferResources</b> only while you hold the mutex. In fact, you can't offer shared resources unless you use <b>IDXGIKeyedMutex</b> because offering shared resources without using <b>IDXGIKeyedMutex</b> isn't supported.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The user mode display driver might not immediately offer the resources that you specified in a call to <b>OfferResources</b>. The driver can postpone offering them until the next call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Bb174576(v=VS.85).aspx">IDXGISwapChain::Present</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/F795A719-71BA-4A25-B41A-9D93F96B6CA4">IDXGISwapChain1::Present1</a>, or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e204c585-4996-4274-a654-b9912e957fe6">ID3D11DeviceContext::Flush</a>. </div>
<div> </div>
<b>Platform Update for Windows 7:  </b>The runtime validates that <b>OfferResources</b> is used correctly on non-shared resources but doesn't perform the intended functionality. For more info about the Platform Update for Windows 7, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/C6DC0D38-E17C-4924-AF7C-6AE74C6C50D1">Platform Update for Windows 7</a>.
