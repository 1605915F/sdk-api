# GetCurrentThreadEffectiveToken function


## -description


Retrieves a pseudo-handle that you can use as a shorthand way to refer to the token that is currently in effect for the thread, which is the thread token if one exists and the process token otherwise. 


## -parameters






## -returns



A pseudo-handle that you can use as a shorthand way to refer to the token that is currently in effect for the thread.




## -remarks



A pseudo-handle is a special constant that can function as the effective token for the current thread.  The calling thread can use a pseudo-handle to specify the effective token for that thread whenever a token handle is required.  Child processes do not inherit pseudo-handles.

Starting in Windows 8, this pseudo-handle has only TOKEN_QUERY and TOKEN_QUERY_SOURCE access rights. 


A thread can create a standard handle that is valid in the context of other processes and can be inherited by other processes. To create this standard handle, call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9c8da574-5bda-49f1-a6b6-c026639d6504">DuplicateHandle</a> function and specify the pseudo-handle as the source handle.

You do not need to close the pseudo-handle when you no longer need it. If you call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9b84891d-62ca-4ddc-97b7-c4c79482abd9">CloseHandle</a> function with a pseudo-handle, the function has no effect. If you call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9c8da574-5bda-49f1-a6b6-c026639d6504">DuplicateHandle</a> to duplicate the pseudo-handle, however, you must close the duplicate handle .
