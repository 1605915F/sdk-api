# APOInitBaseStruct structure


## -description


The APOInitBaseStruct structure is the base initialization header that must precede other  
initialization data in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b73c2e18-ab7b-4e34-9440-f38891f99bf7">IAudioProcessingObject::Initialize</a>. 


## -struct-fields




### -field cbSize

The total size of the structure in bytes.


### -field clsid

The Class ID (CLSID) of the APO.


## -remarks



If the specified CLSID does not match, then the APOInitBaseStruct structure was not designed for this APO, and this is an error condition.  And if the CLSID of the APO changes  
    between versions, then the CLSID may also be used for version management.  In the case where the CLSID is used for version management, a previous version may still be supported by the APO.
