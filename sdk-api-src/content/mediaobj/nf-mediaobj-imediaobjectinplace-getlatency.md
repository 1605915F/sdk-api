# IMediaObjectInPlace::GetLatency


## -description



The <code>GetLatency</code> method retrieves the latency introduced by this DMO.




## -parameters




### -param pLatencyTime [out]

Pointer to a variable that receives the latency, in 100-nanosecond units.


## -returns



Returns S_OK if successful. Otherwise, returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value indicating the cause of the error.




## -remarks



This method returns the average time required to process each buffer. This value usually depends on factors in the run-time environment, such as the processor speed and the CPU load. One possible way to implement this method is for the DMO to keep a running average based on historical data.
