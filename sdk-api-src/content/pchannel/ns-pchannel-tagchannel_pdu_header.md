# tagCHANNEL_PDU_HEADER structure


## -description


Contains information about a data block being received by the server end of a virtual channel.


## -struct-fields




### -field length

Size, in bytes, of the data block, excluding this header.


### -field flags

Information about the data block. The following bit flags will be set. Note that you should not make direct 
      comparisons using the '==' operator when comparing the values in the following list; instead, use the comparison 
      methods described in the list.



#### CHANNEL_FLAG_FIRST (1)

The chunk is the beginning of the data written by a single write operation.

Use bitwise comparisons when comparing this flag.



#### CHANNEL_FLAG_LAST (2)

The chunk is the end of the data written by a single write operation.

Use bitwise comparisons when comparing this flag.



#### CHANNEL_FLAG_MIDDLE (0)

This is the default. The chunk is in the middle of a block of data written by a single write operation.

Do not use bitwise comparisons to compare this flag value directly. Instead, use bitwise comparisons to 
         determine that the flag value is not <b>CHANNEL_FLAG_FIRST</b> or 
         <b>CHANNEL_FLAG_LAST</b>. This is done by using the following comparison:

<code>Result = !(flags &amp; CHANNEL_FLAG_FIRST) &amp;&amp; !(flags &amp; CHANNEL_FLAG_LAST)</code>



#### CHANNEL_FLAG_ONLY (3)

Combines the <b>CHANNEL_FLAG_FIRST</b> and <b>CHANNEL_FLAG_LAST</b>values. The chunk contains all the data from a single write operation.

Use bitwise comparisons when comparing this flag.


## -remarks



In certain cases, Remote Desktop Services places a 
    <b>CHANNEL_PDU_HEADER</b> structure at the beginning 
    of each chunk of data read by a call to the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7434e761-303f-496f-81cb-83c199ddec8a">WTSVirtualChannelRead</a> function. This will 
    occur if the client DLL sets the <b>CHANNEL_OPTION_SHOW_PROTOCOL</b> option when it calls the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3dae59dc-e70f-450e-a324-a4d68341a72e">VirtualChannelInit</a> function to initialize the 
    virtual channel. This will also occur if the channel is a dynamic virtual channel written to by using the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fef7067c-6d81-42b7-8534-191bc98906d4">IWTSVirtualChannel::Write</a> method.
