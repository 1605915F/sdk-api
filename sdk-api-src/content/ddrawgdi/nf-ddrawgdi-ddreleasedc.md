# DdReleaseDC function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This function is subject to change with each operating system revision. Instead, use the Microsoft DirectDraw and Microsoft Direct3DAPIs; these APIs insulate applications from such operating system changes, and hide many other difficulties involved in interacting directly with display drivers.]

Wrapper for the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms648696(v=VS.85).aspx">NtGdiDdReleaseDC</a> function and releases a device context (DC) previously obtained through <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms648439(v=VS.85).aspx">DdGetDC</a> or <b>GdiEntry7</b>.


<b>GdiEntry8</b> is defined as an alias for this function.


## -parameters

## -remarks
