# IXMLHTTPRequest2Callback::OnResponseReceived


## -description


Occurs when a client has received a complete response from the server.


## -parameters




### -param pXHR [in, optional]

The initial HTTP request object


### -param pResponseStream [in, optional]

The response stream being received. The client can call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/934a90bb-5ed0-4d80-9906-352ad8586655">ISequentialStream::Read</a> to begin processing the data, or it can store a reference to <i>pResponseStream</i> for later processing. This response stream is wrapped in a stream synchronization object that prevents concurrent read and write operations, so the application does not need to implement custom synchronization.


## -returns



Returns <b>S_OK</b> on success.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This callback function must not throw exceptions.</div>
<div> </div>



## -remarks



When this event fires the application can begin processing data from the HTTP response. Processing may begin before this event fires if an earlier <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/068C3288-A872-43FA-BF1F-D7A3CD2E2203">OnDataAvailable</a> event has occurred.

Unless <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/532C97A7-B952-47BE-A9C7-5B1E5AB4C3D3">OnError</a> is called, the call to <b>OnResponseReceived</b> is the final callback. The client should perform any required cleanup including releasing references to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/BBC11C4A-AECF-4D6D-8275-3E852E309908">IXMLHTTPRequest2</a> object.

Custom streams receive a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f0323dda-6c31-4411-bf20-9650162109c0">ISequentialStream::Write</a> specifying 0 bytes written before <b>OnResponseReceived</b> is fired. The client can process data directly from the Write call instead of calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/934a90bb-5ed0-4d80-9906-352ad8586655">ISequentialStream::Read</a> on the custom stream, and it can rely on the zero-byte Write call to indicate that the response has been received.
