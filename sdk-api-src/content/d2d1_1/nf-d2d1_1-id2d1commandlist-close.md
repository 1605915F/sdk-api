# ID2D1CommandList::Close


## -description


Instructs the command list to stop accepting commands so that you can use it as an input to an effect or in a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1235dd6d-8495-4a92-96b7-4d741d9e296f">ID2D1DeviceContext::DrawImage</a>.  You should call the method after it has been attached to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a54dd628-c2a2-4b04-9ced-7749a395f187">ID2D1DeviceContext</a>  and written to but before the command list is used.

<table>
<tr>
<th>HRESULT</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>S_OK</td>
<td>No error occurred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D2DERR_WRONG_STATE </td>
<td>Close has already been called on the command list.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If the device context associated with the command list has an error, the command list returns the same error.</div>
<div> </div>





## -remarks



This method returns D2DERR_WRONG_STATE if it has already been called on the command list. If an error occurred on the device context during population, the method returns that error. Otherwise, the method returns S_OK. 

If the <b>Close</b> method returns an error, any future use of the command list results in the same error.
