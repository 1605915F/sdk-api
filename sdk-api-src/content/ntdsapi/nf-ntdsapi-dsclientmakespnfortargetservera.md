# DsClientMakeSpnForTargetServerA function


## -description


The <b>DsClientMakeSpnForTargetServer</b> function constructs a service principal name (SPN) that identifies a specific server to use for authentication.


## -parameters




### -param ServiceClass [in]

Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the class of the service as defined by the service. This can be any string unique to the service.


### -param ServiceName [in]

Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the distinguished name service (DNS) host name. This can either be a fully qualified name or an IP address in the Internet standard  format.

Use of an IP address for <i>ServiceName</i> is not recommended because this can create a security issue. Before the SPN is constructed, the IP address must be translated to a computer name through DNS name resolution. It is possible for the DNS name resolution to be spoofed, replacing the  intended computer name with an unauthorized computer name.


### -param pcSpnLength [in, out]

Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> value that, on entry, contains the size of the <i>pszSpn</i> buffer, in characters. On output, this parameter receives the number of characters copied to the  <i>pszSpn</i> buffer, including the terminating <b>NULL</b>.


### -param pszSpn [out]

Pointer to a string buffer that receives the SPN.


## -returns



This function returns standard Windows error codes.




## -remarks



When using this function, supply the service class and part of a DNS host name.

This function is a simplified version of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fca3c59c-bb81-42a0-acd3-2e55c902febe">DsMakeSpn</a> function. The <i>ServiceName</i> is made canonical by resolving through DNS.

GUID-based DNS names are not supported. When constructed, the simplified SPN is as follows:

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>ServiceClass / ServiceName / ServiceName</code></pre>
The instance name portion (second position) is always set to default. The port and referrer fields are not used.
