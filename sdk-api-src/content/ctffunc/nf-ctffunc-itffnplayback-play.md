## -parameters




### -param pRange [in]

Pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms628908(v=VS.85).aspx">ITfRange</a> object that covers the text to play the audio data for. This range object is obtained by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms538962(v=VS.85).aspx">ITfFnPlayBack::QueryRange</a>.

If the range has zero length, the range played is expanded to cover the entire spoken phrase. If the range has a nonzero length, the range played is expanded to include the entire word, or words, that the range partially covers.
