# FaxRouteDeviceChangeNotification function


## -description


The fax service calls the <b>FaxRouteDeviceChangeNotification</b> function to inform a fax routing extension DLL that a fax device has been removed from the fax server, or that a new fax device has been installed. Each fax routing extension must export the <b>FaxRouteDeviceChangeNotification</b> function.


## -parameters




### -param DeviceId [in]

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that is the device identifier of the fax device that has been removed or installed. 


### -param NewDevice [in]

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Specifies a Boolean variable that indicates whether the <i>DeviceId</i> parameter identifies a new device. If this parameter is equal to <b>TRUE</b>, the device is a new device. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


## -returns



Type: <b>BOOL</b>

If the function succeeds, the return value is a nonzero value.

If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, the fax service calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d852e148-985c-416f-a5a7-27b6914b45d4">GetLastError</a>, described in MSDN.




## -remarks



If the <i>NewDevice</i> parameter is equal to <b>TRUE</b>, it indicates that the fax service detects the installation of a new fax device. The fax routing extension must perform any initialization procedures necessary to enable the extension to route inbound fax transmissions using the new device.

If the <i>NewDevice</i> parameter is equal to <b>FALSE</b>, it indicates that the fax service detects the removal of the fax device identified by the <i>DeviceId</i> parameter. The fax routing extension should perform required cleanup routines at this time.
