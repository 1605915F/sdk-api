<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>

<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION)</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8ab63ed5-7b71-4f28-926d-a24666f0dd15">Close</a> was called before <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5bd24e7c-f2f4-4cc4-abc0-176ed024fa43">Write</a> was called. You must call <b>Write</b> before closing the attachment stream.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STG_S_BLOCK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Internal buffers were not available. The data in the attachment stream was not successfully transferred.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



<b>Close</b> is used to indicate that the application has no more data to transmit in the current attachment stream. The return value can indicate an error in a previous Write operation or an issue closing the connection.

<b>Close</b> may block while waiting for a previous <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5bd24e7c-f2f4-4cc4-abc0-176ed024fa43">Write</a> operation to complete.
<b>Close</b> may block for up to 30 seconds (per HTTP transmission timeouts) while waiting for a  previous <b>Write</b> operation to complete.


 The <b>Close</b> method may return successfully after a failed  <b>Close</b> attempt that returned <b>STG_S_BLOCK</b>.  A subsequent success indicates that the internal buffers were freed for use after the initial failed attempt. When <b>STG_S_BLOCK</b> is received by an application, the application can either call <b>Close</b> again or terminate  the data transfer using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/add0160c-bbf7-446e-8592-a05fd4d16fac">Abort</a> method.
