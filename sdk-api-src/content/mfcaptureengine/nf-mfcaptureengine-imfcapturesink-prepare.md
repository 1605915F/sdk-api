## -remarks



Calling this method is optional. This method gives the application an opportunity to configure the pipeline components before they are used. The method is asynchronous. If the method returns a success code, the caller will receive an <b>MF_CAPTURE_SINK_PREPARED</b> event through the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/26C5B2E5-0543-49FC-915A-DCE097FF66BA">IMFCaptureEngineOnEventCallback::OnEvent</a> method.  After this event is received, call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/591F0E3D-01A8-420F-86C6-2C610643EB69">IMFCaptureSink::GetService</a> to configure individual components.

Before calling this method, configure the capture sink by adding at least one stream. To add a stream, call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5D7A1FE0-92B9-4CC4-A268-17FA848055A9">IMFCaptureSink::AddStream</a>.

The <b>Prepare</b> method fails if the capture sink is currently in use. For example, calling <b>Prepare</b> on the preview sink fails if the capture engine is currently previewing.
