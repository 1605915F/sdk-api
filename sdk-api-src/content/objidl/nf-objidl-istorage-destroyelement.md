# IStorage::DestroyElement


## -description


The 
<b>DestroyElement</b> method
			 removes the specified storage or stream from this storage object.


## -parameters




### -param pwcsName [in]

A pointer to a wide character null-terminated Unicode string that contains the name of the storage or stream to be removed.


## -returns



This method can return one of these values.




## -remarks



The 
<b>DestroyElement</b> method deletes a substorage or stream from the current storage object. After a successful call to 
<b>DestroyElement</b>, any open instance of the destroyed element from the parent storage becomes invalid.

If a storage object is opened in the transacted mode, destruction of an element requires that the call to 
<b>DestroyElement</b> be followed by a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/72831f2c-1e07-429b-af4c-2aaced3f3888">IStorage::Commit</a>.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <b>DestroyElement</b> method does not shrink the directory stream.  It only marks the deleted directory entry as invalid.  Invalid entries are reused when creating a new storage or stream.  <p class="note">For content streams, the deleted stream sectors are marked as free. If the free sectors are at the end of the file, the document file should shrink.  To compact a document file, call <b>IStorage::CopyTo</b> on the root storage object and copy to a new storage object.
