# IRunnableObject::IsRunning


## -description


Determines whether an object is currently in the running state.


## -parameters






## -returns



If the object is in the running state, the return value is <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise, it is <b>FALSE</b>.




## -remarks



A container application could call <b>IRunnableObject::IsRunning</b> when it needs to know if the server is immediately available. For example, a container's implementation of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/08569037-7ecd-4e63-9f94-c2552c327800">IOleItemContainer::GetObject</a> method would return an error if the server is not running and the bindspeed parameter specifies BINDSPEED_IMMEDIATE.

An object handler could call <b>IRunnableObject::IsRunning</b> when it wants to avoid conflicts with a running server or when the running server might have more up-to-date information. For example, a handler's implementation of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/babaf55e-6c43-48d8-ad13-1333e29a3e1d">IOleObject::GetExtent</a> would delegate to the object server if it is running, because the server's information might be more current than that in the handler's cache.


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9392666f-c269-4667-aeac-67c68bcc5f06">OleIsRunning</a> is a helper function that conveniently repackages the functionality offered by <b>IRunnableObject::IsRunning</b>. With the release of OLE 2.01, the implementation of <b>OleIsRunning</b> was changed so that it calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/54d5ff80-18db-43f2-b636-f93ac053146d">QueryInterface</a>, asks for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c682447b-5b12-41d5-a81d-fe94a117f740">IRunnableObject</a>, and then calls <b>IRunnableObject::IsRunning</b>. In other words, you can use the interface and the helper function interchangeably.
