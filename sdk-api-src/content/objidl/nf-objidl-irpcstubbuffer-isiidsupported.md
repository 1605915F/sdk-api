# IRpcStubBuffer::IsIIDSupported


## -description


Determines whether a stub is designed to handle the unmarshaling of a particular interface.


## -parameters




### -param riid [in]

The IID of the interface. This parameter cannot be IID_IUnknown.


## -returns



If the stub can handle the indicated interface, then this method returns an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0aa724f0-6110-4ebf-a0c1-d309074a61d9">IRpcStubBuffer</a> pointer  for that interface; otherwise, it returns <b>NULL</b>.




## -remarks



When presented with the need to remote a new IID on a given object, the RPC run time typically calls this method on all the presently-connected interface stubs in an attempt to locate one that can handle the marshaling for the request before it goes to the trouble of creating a new stub.

As in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/45e2a4c3-6a78-4018-9f32-ce5523682c0f">IPSFactoryBuffer::CreateStub</a>, if a stub is presently connected to a server object, then not only must this method verify that the stub can handle the indicated interface, but it must also verify (using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/54d5ff80-18db-43f2-b636-f93ac053146d">QueryInterface</a>) that the connected server object in fact supports the indicated interface. Depending on the IID and previous interface servicing requests, it may have already done so.
