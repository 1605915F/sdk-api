## -remarks



This method loads an object from its associated stream. The seek pointer is set as it was in the most recent <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b748b4f9-ef9c-486b-bdc4-4d23c4640ff7">IPersistStream::Save</a> method. This method can seek and read from the stream, but cannot write to it.

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Callers"></a><a id="notes_to_callers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_CALLERS"></a>Notes to Callers</h3>
Rather than calling <b>IPersistStream::Load</b> directly, you typically call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2d54a0ef-906b-4886-a095-4ff2f3d4e634">OleLoadFromStream</a> function does the following:

<ol>
<li>Calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bcf11c5b-e164-4a0f-b30f-ee9e76c4356d">ReadClassStm</a> function to get the class identifier from the stream.</li>
<li>Calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7295a55b-12c7-4ed0-a7a4-9ecee16afdec">CoCreateInstance</a> function to create an instance of the object.</li>
<li>Queries the instance for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/97ea64ee-d950-4872-add6-1f532a6eb33f">IPersistStream</a>.</li>
<li>Calls <b>IPersistStream::Load</b>.</li>
</ol>
The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2d54a0ef-906b-4886-a095-4ff2f3d4e634">OleLoadFromStream</a> function assumes that objects are stored in the stream with a class identifier followed by the object data. This storage pattern is used by the generic, composite-moniker implementation provided by OLE.

If the objects are not stored using this pattern, you must call the methods separately yourself.


<h3><a id="URL_Moniker_Notes"></a><a id="url_moniker_notes"></a><a id="URL_MONIKER_NOTES"></a>URL Moniker Notes</h3>
Initializes an URL moniker from data within a stream, usually stored there previously using its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b748b4f9-ef9c-486b-bdc4-4d23c4640ff7">IPersistStream::Save</a> (using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0085c6a8-1a94-4379-9937-c8d792d130da">OleSaveToStream</a>). The binary format of the URL moniker is its URL string in Unicode (may be a full or partial URL string, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms775103(v=VS.85).aspx">CreateURLMonikerEx</a> for details). This is represented as a <b>ULONG</b> count of characters followed by that many Unicode characters.
