# IDirectDrawSurface7::SetLOD


## -description


Sets the maximum level of detail (LOD) for a managed mipmap surface. This method succeeds only on managed textures.


## -parameters






#### - dwMaxLOD [in]

The maximum LOD value to be set for the mipmap chain if the call succeeds.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, the return value is DD_OK.



If it fails, the method can return one of the following error values:

<ul>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT</li>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDPARAMS</li>
</ul>



## -remarks



Applications can call this method only for managed textures (those surfaces that were created with the DDSCAPS2_TEXTUREMANAGE flag). If you call <b>SetLOD</b> on a nonmanaged texture, <b>SetLOD</b> fails and returns DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT.

<b>SetLOD</b> communicates to the Direct3D texture manager the most detailed mipmap in this chain that it should load into local video memory. For example, in a five-level mipmap chain, if you set <i>dwMaxLOD</i> to 2, the texture manager should load only mipmap levels 2 through 4 into local video memory at any given time. Likewise, if the most detailed mipmap in the chain has the dimensions 256×256, setting the maximum level to 2 means that the largest mipmap ever present in video memory has dimensions 64×64.
