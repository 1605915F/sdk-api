# IScanningTuner::AutoProgram


## -description



The <b>AutoProgram</b> method scans for all channels with valid programming.




## -parameters






## -returns



When the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



This method returns immediately, and the scan continues in the background. If the device allows it, the scan can be canceled by calling any other tuning operation. Otherwise, the scan will complete once all channels have been visited once. Internal devices will likely have a software implementation of this feature, and will collect fine-tuning information resulting from the scan. External devices will likely implement this feature, so this is just a means to trigger the process.

Currently the DVB-C and DVB-S Network Provider filters do not implement this method, and return E_NOTIMPL. The method is implemented for DVB-T.
