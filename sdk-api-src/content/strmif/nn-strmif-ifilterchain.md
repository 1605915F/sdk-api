# IFilterChain interface


## -description



The <code>IFilterChain</code> interface provides methods for starting, stopping, or removing chains of filters in a filter graph. The filter graph manager exposes this interface.

A <i>filter chain</i> is a sequence of filters, each with at most one connected input pin and one connected output pin, that forms an unbroken line of filters. A filter chain is defined by the filter at the start of the chain and the filter at the end of the chain. (These can be the same filter, making a chain of one filter.) By definition, there is a single stream path going from the start of the chain downstream to the end of the chain.

The methods on this interface are useful in situations where an entire stream of data can appear or disappear, such as a video conferencing application that receives multiple streams over a network. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/13fed430-979b-40f7-91ba-aff2d811bd92">Dynamic Graph Building</a>. To control individual streams on a capture filter, use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/126c7ed7-acc0-4248-a3ab-c91c9f1c5cee">IAMStreamControl</a> interface instead.
