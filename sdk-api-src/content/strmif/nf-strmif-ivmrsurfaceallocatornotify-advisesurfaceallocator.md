# IVMRSurfaceAllocatorNotify::AdviseSurfaceAllocator


## -description



The <code>AdviseSurfaceAllocator</code> method is called by an application to instruct the VMR to use a custom allocator-presenter.




## -parameters




### -param dwUserID [in]

An application-defined DWORD_PTR that uniquely identifies this instance of the VMR in scenarios when multiple instances of the VMR are being used with a single instance of an allocator-presenter.


### -param lpIVRMSurfaceAllocator [in]

Specifies the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bbcbe152-80fd-469b-a79b-c8db6f97da22">IVMRSurfaceAllocator</a> interface on the new allocator-presenter. If this value is <b>NULL</b>, then the VMR will release the client allocator-presenter and restore its default allocator-presenter.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, it returns an error code.




## -remarks



The method will cause the default allocator-presenter to be uninstalled and destroyed, and replaced with the specified new component. The new component must also support the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cb9b1e29-45c3-4208-8343-c2924505a9f3">IVMRImagePresenter</a> interface.

This method can be called only once in the lifetime of the VMR. The VMR continues to use the allocator-presenter until the VMR is itself deleted. When the VMR is finally released, it releases its reference count on the custom allocator-presenter object, which allows that object to be freed.
