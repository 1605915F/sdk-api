# IAMBufferNegotiation interface


## -description



The <code>IAMBufferNegotiation</code> interface requests the number of buffers for a filter to create and size of each buffer. This interface can be exposed by any pin that connects using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a4407c6f-6bb5-4274-920b-8bf7d76268bc">IMemInputPin</a> pin interface, but is typically exposed on the output pins of capture filters.

When two pins connect through <b>IMemInputPin</b>, they agree on an allocator object that is responsible for creating buffers. Normally this process is transparent to the application, but in some situations the application needs more control. If a pin exposes <code>IAMBufferNegotiation</code>, the application can suggest how many buffers to create, the size of the buffers, and other properties. If your application performs preview of captured audio, you can specify a smaller buffer size to reduce latency. Teleconferencing applications should specify a minimal number of buffers.

To use this interface, call the <b>SuggestAllocatorProperties</b> method before the pins connect. After the pins connect, call the <b>GetAllocatorProperties</b> method to determine whether the pin honored the request.

<b>Filter developers</b>: Capture filters should always support this interface when possible.




## -inheritance
