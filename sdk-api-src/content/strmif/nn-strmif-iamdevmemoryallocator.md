# IAMDevMemoryAllocator interface


## -description



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This interface is no longer supported by the AVI Splitter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This interface was defined to support older hardware decoders that required AVI files to be read into directly hardware memory. The interface enables the AVI parser to allocate memory from the downstream filter but still provide its own allocator.</div>
<div> </div>
Implement this interface when your pin must support the creation of on-board memory allocators. Source filters that are aware of on-board memory and need to create their own allocators should query for this interface, request an amount of memory and then create an allocator (aggregating the device memory control object). Source filters that don't need to create their own allocator could just use the allocator of the downstream pin (which also aggregates the device memory control object). The hardware-based filter can confirm the usage of its on-board memory by calling methods on the aggregated allocator.

Use this interface when applications need to control the memory of codecs with on-board memory.




## -inheritance
