# IFileSinkFilter interface


## -description



The <code>IFileSinkFilter</code> interface is implemented on filters that write media streams to a file. A file sink filter in a video capture filter graph, for instance, writes the output of the video compression filter to a file. Typically, the application running this filter graph should enable the user to enter the name of the file to be written to. This interface enables the communication of this information.

If a filter needs the name of an output file, it should expose this interface to allow an application to set the file name. Note that there is currently no base class implementation of this interface.

Any application that must set the name of the file into which the file sink filter will write should use this interface to get and set the file name.
