# IOleWindow interface


## -description


The <b>IOleWindow</b> interface provides methods that allow an application to obtain the handle to the various windows that participate in in-place activation, and also to enter and exit context-sensitive help mode.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IOleWindow</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680509(v=VS.85).aspx">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IOleWindow</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IOleWindow</b> interface has these methods.

## -remarks



Several other in-place activation interfaces are derived from the <b>IOleWindow</b> interface. Containers and objects must implement and use these interfaces in order to support in-place activation. The following table briefly summarizes each of these interfaces.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Interface</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>IOleWindow</b></td>
<td>
The base interface. Implemented and used by containers and objects to obtain window handles and manage context-sensitive help. This interface is not supported for use across machine boundaries.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c14de79d-e844-49cf-ae70-6c3e417fab90">IOleInPlaceObject</a>
</td>
<td>
Implemented by objects and used by an object's immediate container to activate and deactivate the object.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b077c256-1109-494c-95c2-2d33bccbe47b">IOleInPlaceActiveObject</a>
</td>
<td>
Implemented by objects and used by the top-level container to manipulate the object while it is active. Provides a direct channel of communication between an active object and its frame and document windows.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3cfb31aa-9746-438c-af64-8236c170fe88">IOleInPlaceUIWindow</a>
</td>
<td>
Implemented by containers and used by objects to manipulate the container's document window.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c530aff7-fd83-413d-8945-0c9d1bfb51ba">IOleInPlaceFrame</a>
</td>
<td>
Implemented by containers and used by objects to control the container's frame window.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6d37e022-8c19-48b3-affb-e0eca19b5e05">IOleInPlaceSite</a>
</td>
<td>
Implemented by containers and used by objects to interact with the in-place client site.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d93e6d23-7867-43e4-8ab9-efe609362c18">IOleInPlaceSiteEx</a>
</td>
<td>
Implemented by containers and called by objects to optimize activation and deactivation.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4ad83599-99d2-4b35-95de-cff845a8d5e4">IOleInPlaceSiteWindowless</a>
</td>
<td>
Implemented by containers and called by windowless object to obtain services from its container.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/86aabb46-6bc7-4953-b4eb-8692552ca380">IOleInPlaceObjectWindowless</a>
</td>
<td>
Implemented by windowless objects called by containers to support window message processing and drag and drop operations for windowless objects.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

These interfaces can be arranged in three hierarchical levels with various interfaces implemented at each level. Calls that install user-interface menus commands and frame adornments, activate and switch between windows, and dispatch menu and keystrokes take place between the top-level container and the active object. Calls that support activating, deactivating, scrolling, or clipping span the containment hierarchy, with each level performing the correct actions.
