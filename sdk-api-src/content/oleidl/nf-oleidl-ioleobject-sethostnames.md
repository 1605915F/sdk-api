## -remarks



<h3><a id="Notes_for_Callers"></a><a id="notes_for_callers"></a><a id="NOTES_FOR_CALLERS"></a>Notes for Callers</h3>
Call <b>IOleObject::SetHostNames</b> only for embedded objects, because for linked objects, the link source provides its own separate editing window and title bar information.

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Implementers"></a><a id="notes_to_implementers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_IMPLEMENTERS"></a>Notes to Implementers</h3>
An object's application of <b>IOleObject::SetHostNames</b> should include whatever modifications to its user interface may be appropriate to an object's embedded state. Such modifications typically will include adding and removing menu commands and altering the text displayed in the title bar of the editing window.

The complete window title for an embedded object in an SDI container application or an MDI application with a maximized child window should appear as follows:

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>&lt;object application name&gt; - &lt;object short type&gt; in &lt;container document&gt;</code></pre>
Otherwise, the title should be:

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>&lt;object application name&gt; - &lt;container document&gt;</code></pre>
The "object short type" refers to a form of an object's name short enough to be displayed in full in a list box. Because these identifying strings are not stored as part of the persistent state of the object, <b>IOleObject::SetHostNames</b> must be called each time the object loads or runs.
