# CVssWriterEx2 class


## -description


The <b>CVssWriterEx2</b> class is an abstract base class that defines 
    the interface by which a writer synchronizes its state with VSS and other writers.

The <b>CVssWriterEx2</b> class inherits the methods of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/29820c1d-2add-402d-a9ca-9e8674d85f7f">CVssWriterEx</a> class.

Every writer must create an instance of the  
    <b>CVssWriterEx2</b>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/29820c1d-2add-402d-a9ca-9e8674d85f7f">CVssWriterEx</a>, or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5d54c966-86ad-41af-82be-8a182b3d203a">CVssWriter</a>  class.

Objects that are derived from <b>CVssWriterEx2</b> must supply implementations 
    for all of the pure virtual methods of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/29820c1d-2add-402d-a9ca-9e8674d85f7f">CVssWriterEx</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5d54c966-86ad-41af-82be-8a182b3d203a">CVssWriter</a> classes.

A writer can override any or all of  the virtual 
    methods of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/29820c1d-2add-402d-a9ca-9e8674d85f7f">CVssWriterEx</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5d54c966-86ad-41af-82be-8a182b3d203a">CVssWriter</a>. However, a writer can override the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/542d479a-695a-4b1f-94e7-f2ffa08440b7">OnIdentify</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4cb3b8f6-f702-4fba-a3cc-af84897cfd82">OnIdentifyEx</a> method, but not both.

<b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">CVssWriterEx2</b> has these types of members:
