# CVssWriter class


## -description


The <b>CVssWriter</b> class is an abstract base class that defines 
    the interface by which a writer synchronizes its state with VSS and other writers.

Every writer must instantiate an object derived from 
    <b>CVssWriter</b>.

Objects derived from <b>CVssWriter</b> must supply implementations 
    for all of the <b>CVssWriter</b>'s pure virtual methods.

A writer can override one or all of <b>CVssWriter</b>'s virtual 
    methods.

To participate in VSS, a writer must first call 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a427ebbd-b7c4-46ba-ba16-dd601b1f956e">CVssWriter::Initialize</a> and then call 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ab9520c9-bd6b-4c81-87fc-f5cda6ee9c94">CVssWriter::Subscribe</a>.

A writer terminates its participation by calling 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b2bb68d1-7beb-4ba1-b16d-6314ac3f4a3d">CVssWriter::Unsubscribe</a>.

The <b>CVssWriter</b> base class is responsible for the life cycle 
    of interfaces passed to event handlers. This includes the following:
<ul>
<li>The instance of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e8ff2491-014c-43c7-bdce-99ed3b408605">IVssWriterComponents</a> 
     interface passed to:
