# CVssWriter::OnPrepareSnapshot


## -description


The 
<b>OnPrepareSnapshot</b> method is called by a writer to handle a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa384664(v=VS.85).aspx">PrepareForSnapshot</a> event. It is used to perform operations needed to prepare a writer to participate in the shadow copy or to veto a shadow copy.

<b>OnPrepareSnapshot</b> is a pure virtual method. It is not implemented by the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5d54c966-86ad-41af-82be-8a182b3d203a">CVssWriter</a> base class, and must be implemented by derived classes.


## -parameters






## -returns



The implementation of this method must return <b>true</b> except in the case of a fatal error.
      If a fatal error occurs, the method must call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9fef9d77-dc0d-4ba0-a317-5c62355458f7">CVssWriter::SetWriterFailure</a> method to provide a description of the failure before returning <b>false</b>. If a nonfatal error occurs, the method should still call  <b>SetWriterFailure</b> but return <b>true</b>. If the error is caused by a transient problem, the method should specify VSS_E_WRITERERROR_RETRYABLE in the call to <b>SetWriterFailure</b>.

  In all cases when a failure occurs, the method should write an event to the event log to report the exact reason for the failure.




## -remarks



The 
<b>OnPrepareSnapshot</b> method performs operations that are required prior to any shadow copy freeze.

The time-out window for handling a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa384664(v=VS.85).aspx">PrepareForSnapshot</a> event is typically longer than that for handling a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa384656(v=VS.85).aspx">Freeze</a> event. Therefore, developers can use 
<b>OnPrepareSnapshot</b> to handle more time-consuming operations. A typical use might be for the writer to explicitly checkpoint its data.

Writers should never throw an exception from this method or any other <b>CVssWriter(Ex)::On<i>Xxx</i></b> callback method.

If this method calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bea5ba9c-538b-453f-ae6d-12b94b8edeb6">CVssWriterEx2::GetSessionId</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9fef9d77-dc0d-4ba0-a317-5c62355458f7">CVssWriter::SetWriterFailure</a>, or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c049a016-6546-4e72-90e8-46be8c2f7764">CVssWriterEx2::SetWriterFailureEx</a> method, it must do so in  the same thread that called this method. For more information, see 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa384993(v=VS.85).aspx">Writer Event Handling</a>.
