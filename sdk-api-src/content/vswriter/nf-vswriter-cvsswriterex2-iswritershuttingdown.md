# CVssWriterEx2::IsWriterShuttingDown


## -description


Determines whether the writer is shutting down.


## -parameters






## -returns



Returns <b>true</b> if the writer is shutting down, or <b>false</b> otherwise.




## -remarks



The writer implementation should call this method periodically during long-running events where the writer is performing a large amount of processing or looping. If this method returns <b>true</b> during the event, the writer should do the following:

<ol>
<li>Log an error to the Application Event Log event. This is optional, but recommended.</li>
<li>Call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9fef9d77-dc0d-4ba0-a317-5c62355458f7">SetWriterFailure</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c049a016-6546-4e72-90e8-46be8c2f7764">SetWriterFailureEx</a>, passing a non-retryable error code for the <i>hr</i> or <i>hrWriter</i> parameter.</li>
</ol>
