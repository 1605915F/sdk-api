# PS_ADAPTER_STATS structure


## -description


The 
<b>PS_ADAPTER_STATS</b> structure provides statistical packet shaper information about a specified adapter. Note that the 
<b>PS_ADAPTER_STATS</b> structure is used in conjunction with the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6263d80a-5486-4748-b3a7-4c9d9bb2162f">PS_COMPONENT_STATS</a> structure.


## -struct-fields




### -field OutOfPackets

Number of instances in which the adapter had no packets to transmit on the specified adapter.


### -field FlowsOpened

Number of flows opened on the adapter.


### -field FlowsClosed

Number of flows closed on the adapter.


### -field FlowsRejected

Number of flows that were rejected due to packet shaper constraints on the adapter.


### -field FlowsModified

Number of flows that were modified on the adapter.


### -field FlowModsRejected
