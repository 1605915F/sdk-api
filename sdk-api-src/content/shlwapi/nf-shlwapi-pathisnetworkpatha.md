# PathIsNetworkPathA function


## -description


Determines whether a path string represents a network resource.


## -parameters




### -param pszPath [in]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A pointer to a null-terminated string of maximum length MAX_PATH that contains the path.


## -returns



Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Returns <b>TRUE</b> if the string represents a network resource, or <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.




## -remarks



<b>PathIsNetworkPath</b> interprets the following two types of paths as network paths.

<ul>
<li>Paths that begin with two backslash characters (\\) are interpreted as Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths.</li>
<li>Paths that begin with a letter followed by a colon (:) are interpreted as a mounted network drive. However, <b>PathIsNetworkPath</b> cannot recognize a network drive mapped to a drive letter through the Microsoft MS-DOS SUBST command or the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/924b1456-b2c5-4d52-aacf-6172608c73ea">DefineDosDevice</a> function.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The function does not verify that the specified network resource exists, is currently accessible, or that the user has sufficient permissions to access it.</div>
<div> </div>
