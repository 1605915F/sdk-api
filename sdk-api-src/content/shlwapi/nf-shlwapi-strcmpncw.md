# StrCmpNCW function


## -description


Compares a specified number of characters from the beginning of two strings using C run-time (ASCII) collation rules. The comparison is case-sensitive.


## -parameters




### -param pszStr1 [in]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A pointer to the first null-terminated string to be compared.


### -param pszStr2 [in]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A pointer to the second null-terminated string to be compared.


### -param nChar

Type: <b>int</b>

The number of characters from the beginning of each string to be compared.


## -returns



Type: <b>int</b>

Returns zero if the substrings are identical. Returns a positive value if the string taken from that pointed to by <i>pszStr1</i> is alphabetically greater than the string taken from that pointed to by <i>pszStr2</i>. Returns a negative value if the string taken from that pointed to by <i>pszStr1</i> is alphabetically less than the string taken from that pointed to by <i>pszStr2</i>.




## -remarks



Note that <b>StrCmpNC</b> was designed for comparing canonical strings. These strings are not localized and consist only of characters below ASCII value 128. Therefore, it will not function correctly with a double-byte character set (DBCS) or other multiple-character data.

This function locates the first unequal characters and returns a positive number if the character from the first string is greater than the character from the second, a negative number if it is less, or zero if they are equal. For example, suppose that <i>pszStr1</i>="abczb", <i>pszStr2</i>="abcdefg", and you are comparing the first four characters from each. <b>StrCmpNC</b> determines that the first unequal character is at position four ("z" in <i>pszStr1</i> and "d" in <i>pszStr2</i>) and returns a positive value since the ASCII code for "z" is greater than the ASCII code for "d".

For those versions of Windows that do not include <b>StrCmpNC</b> in Shlwapi.h, this function's individual ANSI or Unicode version must be called directly from Shlwapi.dll. <b>StrCmpNCA</b> is ordinal 151 and <b>StrCmpNCW</b> is ordinal 152.
