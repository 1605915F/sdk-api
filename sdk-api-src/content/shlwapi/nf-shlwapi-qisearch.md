# QISearch function


## -description


A table-driven implementation of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/54d5ff80-18db-43f2-b636-f93ac053146d">IUnknown::QueryInterface</a> method.


## -parameters




### -param that [in]

Type: <b>void*</b>

A pointer to the base of a COM object.


### -param pqit [in]

Type: <b>LPCQITAB</b>

An array of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3a055773-6e53-45e1-8936-011a8b2b8b16">QITAB</a> structures. The last structure in the array must have its <b>piid</b> member set to <b>NULL</b> and its <b>dwOffset</b> member set to 0.


### -param riid [in]

Type: <b>REFIID</b>

A reference to the IID of the interface to retrieve through <i>ppv</i>.


### -param ppv [out]

Type: <b>void**</b>

When this method returns successfully, contains the interface pointer requested in <i>riid</i>.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns S_OK if the requested interface was found in the table or if the requested interface was IUnknown. Returns E_NOINTERFACE if the requested interface was not found.




## -remarks



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Prior to Windows Vista, <b>QISearch</b> was not exported by name or declared in a public header file. To use it in those cases, you must use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a0d7fc09-f888-4f46-a571-d3719a627597">GetProcAddress</a> and request ordinal 219 from Shlwapi.dll to obtain a function pointer. Under Windows Vista, <b>QISearch</b> is included in Shlwapi.h and this is not necessary.</div>
<div> </div>
If the requested interface is IUnknown, then <b>QISearch</b> uses the first entry of the specified array of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3a055773-6e53-45e1-8936-011a8b2b8b16">QITAB</a> structures. Otherwise, <b>QISearch</b> searches the table until it either finds a matching IID or reaches the end of the table.  If a matching IID is found, the function advances the associated interface pointer by the number of bytes specified by the <b>dwOffset</b> member of the interface's <b>QITAB</b> structure and reinterpreted as a COM pointer.  That pointer is assigned to the <b>QISearch</b> function's  <i>ppv</i> parameter. The method also calls IUnknown::AddRef to increment the interface's reference count.

If <b>QISearch</b> reaches the end of the table without finding the interface, it returns E_NOINTERFACE and sets <i>ppv</i> to <b>NULL</b>.

It is important to include all applicable interfaces in the table. For example, if the object implements a derived interface, you should also include the base interface in the table.

We recommend that you use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/268B59FA-44EB-4777-8162-C50981CBDD09">IID_PPV_ARGS</a> macro, defined in Objbase.h, to package the <i>riid</i> and <i>ppv</i> parameters. This macro provides the correct IID based on the interface pointed to by the value in <i>ppv</i>, which eliminates the possibility of a coding error in <i>riid</i> that could lead to unexpected results.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Active Template Library (ATL) provides a significantly better version of a table-driven implementation of QueryInterface.</div>
<div> </div>

#### Examples

The following example illustrates how to use <b>QISearch</b> to implement QueryInterface.  It uses the offsetofclass macro from ATL to compute the offset from the base of the CSample object to a specified interface.

This object supports two interfaces aside from IUnknown, so there are two non-<b>NULL</b> entries in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3a055773-6e53-45e1-8936-011a8b2b8b16">QITAB</a> table. The entry for each interface specifies a pointer to the associated IID (IID_IPersist or IID_IPersistFolder) and the offset of the interface pointer relative to the class's base pointer. The sample uses the <b>offsetofclass</b> macro from ATL to determine that offset.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Forgetting to include all base classes, including indirect ones, is a common error. Notice that there is an entry for the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/932eb0e2-35a6-482e-9138-00cff30508a9">IPersist</a> interface. This interface is an indirect base class for CSample, inherited through <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d37d4ca5-93a0-4090-b657-9b23d5df875c">IPersistFolder</a>. </div>
