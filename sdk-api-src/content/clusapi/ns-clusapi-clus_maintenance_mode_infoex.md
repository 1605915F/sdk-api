## -struct-fields




### -field InMaintenance

Set to <b>TRUE</b> to enable or <b>FALSE</b> to disable maintenance 
      mode for the identified resource.
      When queried, a resource will return <b>True</b> or <b>False</b> to 
       indicate the current maintenance mode state of the resource.


### -field MaintainenceModeType

Unless the resource in question is in a type of maintenance mode, this member is set to 0.  Otherwise this member  takes an <b>enumerator</b> from the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b71f6a3b-4c9d-49f9-b60f-ee4c4fb6b169">MAINTENANCE_MODE_TYPE_ENUM</a> enumeration as its value.  The possible values of this member are as follows.



#### 0

The resource is not in maintenance mode.



#### MaintenanceModeTypeDisableIsAliveCheck (1)

Indicates that the server is ignoring the result of the resource's health check.



#### MaintenanceModeTypeOfflineResource (2)

Indicates that the server has internally performed the operations to bring the storage resource to the ClusterResourceOffline state without changing the client visible state of the resource.



#### MaintenanceModeTypeUnclusterResource (3)

Indicates the server has released ownership of the storage resource.


### -field InternalState

This member represents the internal resource state. This field is valid only when written by the server.  This member takes an enumerator from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bd5dee18-a06f-4e46-a27e-c907b1c25a68">CLUSTER_RESOURCE_STATE</a> enumeration.  The possible values of this member are as follows.



#### ClusterResourceStateUnknown (–1)

The operation was not successful. For more information about the error, call the function 
       <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d852e148-985c-416f-a5a7-27b6914b45d4">GetLastError</a>.



#### ClusterResourceInitializing (1)

The resource is performing initialization.
