# TAPI_DETECTTONE structure


## -description


The 
<b>TAPI_DETECTTONE</b> structure describes a tone to be monitored. This is used as an entry in an array.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwAppSpecific

Used by the application for tagging the tone. When this tone is detected, the value of the <b>dwAppSpecific</b> member is passed back to the application.


### -field dwDuration

The duration, in milliseconds, during which the tone should be present before a detection is made.


### -field dwFrequency1

The frequency, in hertz, of a component of the tone.


### -field dwFrequency2

The frequency, in hertz, of a component of the tone.


### -field dwFrequency3

The frequency, in hertz, of a component of the tone. If fewer than three frequencies are needed in the tone, a value of zero should be used for the unused frequencies. A tone with all three frequencies set to zero is interpreted as silence and can be used for silence detection.
