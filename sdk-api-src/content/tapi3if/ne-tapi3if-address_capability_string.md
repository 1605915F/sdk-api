# ADDRESS_CAPABILITY_STRING enumeration


## -description


The 
<b>ADDRESS_CAPABILITY_STRING</b> enum is used to check on address capabilities which are described by strings.


## -enum-fields




### -field ACS_PROTOCOL

Describes a protocol-specific capability. The value is returned as a GUID in string format. For possible values, see 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4704eedb-12e7-440e-b1ca-2afd78d2499d">TAPIPROTOCOL_</a>. A TSP may define additional values. Corresponds to the <b>ProtocolGuid</b> member of TAPI 2's 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/83e38453-bb93-4cc5-923f-d0cd2898350a">LINEDEVCAPS</a> structure.


### -field ACS_ADDRESSDEVICESPECIFIC

Describes an address device-specific capability. The value is TSP dependent and can be a structure, a string, or some other type. An application should use the <b>BSTR</b> pointer received from Tapi3.dll as a pointer to an array of bytes (a buffer), and then interpret the buffer according to TSP specifications. Corresponds to the <b>dwDevSpecific</b> and <b>dwDevSpecificSize</b> members of TAPI 2's 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c1fe1aaf-2f50-4423-bacf-6a3cf218a809">LINEADDRESSCAPS</a> structure.


### -field ACS_LINEDEVICESPECIFIC

Describes a line device-specific capability. The value is TSP dependent and can be a structure, a string, or some other type. An application should use the <b>BSTR</b> pointer received from Tapi3.dll as a pointer to an array of bytes (a buffer), and then interpret the buffer according to TSP specifications. Corresponds to the <b>dwDevSpecific</b> and <b>dwDevSpecificSize</b> members of TAPI 2's 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/83e38453-bb93-4cc5-923f-d0cd2898350a">LINEDEVCAPS</a> structure.


### -field ACS_PROVIDERSPECIFIC

Describes a provider-specific capability. The value is a plain string. It can be used with regular <b>BSTR</b> functions for operations such as printing and concatenating. A specific TSP might included embedded <b>NULL</b> characters inside these strings. If so, an application should take care when printing the value. If the embedded <b>NULL</b> characters are not replaced with blanks, the strings will appear truncated when printed. Corresponds to the <b>dwProviderInfoSize</b> and <b>dwProviderInfoOffset</b> members of TAPI 2's 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/83e38453-bb93-4cc5-923f-d0cd2898350a">LINEDEVCAPS</a> structure.


### -field ACS_SWITCHSPECIFIC

Describes a switch-specific capability. The value is a plain string. It can be used with regular <b>BSTR</b> functions for operations such as printing and concatenating. A specific TSP might included embedded <b>NULL</b> characters inside these strings. If so, an application should take care when printing the value. If the embedded <b>NULL</b> characters are not replaced with blanks, the strings will appear truncated when printed. Corresponds to the <b>dwSwitchInfoSize</b> and <b>dwSwitchInfoOffset</b> members of TAPI 2's 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/83e38453-bb93-4cc5-923f-d0cd2898350a">LINEDEVCAPS</a> structure.


### -field ACS_PERMANENTDEVICEGUID

Describes the GUID of a permanent device. The value is returned as a GUID in string format. This identifier must remain stable throughout, including operating system upgrades. Corresponds to the <b>PermanentLineGuid</b> member of TAPI 2's 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/83e38453-bb93-4cc5-923f-d0cd2898350a">LINEDEVCAPS</a> structure.
