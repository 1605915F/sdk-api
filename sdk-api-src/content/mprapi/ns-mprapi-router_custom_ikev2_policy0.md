## -description


Contains the IKEv2 main mode and quick mode policy configuration.

Do not use the  <b>ROUTER_CUSTOM_IKEv2_POLICY0</b> structure directly in your code; using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6CF919BD-E1E9-423F-8186-C992A5E6AB89">ROUTER_CUSTOM_IKEv2_POLICY</a> instead ensures that the proper version, based on the operating system the code in compiled under, is used.
