# ROUTER_CUSTOM_IKEv2_POLICY0 structure


## -description


Contains the IKEv2 main mode and quick mode policy configuration.

Do not use the  <b>ROUTER_CUSTOM_IKEv2_POLICY0</b> structure directly in your code; using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/RRAS/router-management-data-types">ROUTER_CUSTOM_IKEv2_POLICY</a> instead ensures that the proper version, based on the operating system the code in compiled under, is used.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwIntegrityMethod
