## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e2e4378f-d842-4bca-bffc-a60e718caed3">CHString</a> class 
    is part of the WMI Provider Framework which is now considered in final state, and no further development, 
    enhancements, or updates will be available for non-security related issues affecting these libraries. The 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7F311E1B-5CE6-488D-9411-DE1822D95C3B">MI APIs</a> should be used for all new 
    development.]

The <b>FreeExtra</b> method frees any extra memory that was previously allocated by the string but is no longer needed. This method, which reallocates the buffer to the exact length returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b898f9d1-b9a2-4c7b-a7c0-1b6b51ae565f">GetLength</a>, should reduce the memory overhead consumed by the string object.
