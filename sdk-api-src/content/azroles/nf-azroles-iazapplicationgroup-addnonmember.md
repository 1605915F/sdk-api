# IAzApplicationGroup::AddNonMember


## -description


The <b>AddNonMember</b> method adds the specified <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3e9d7672-2314-45c8-8178-5a0afcfd0c50">security identifier</a> (SID) in text form to the list of  accounts that are refused membership in the application group.


## -parameters




### -param bstrProp [in]

String that contains the text form of the SID to add to the list of  accounts that are refused membership in the application group.


### -param varReserved [in, optional]

Reserved for future use.


## -remarks



The application group will never have an  account added using this method as a member, even if that account is specified directly or indirectly by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1370fe81-a729-477e-a500-1823abb713e1">Members</a> property.

Denying membership to an account in an application group does not prevent that account from being assigned to a role through a different application group, nor from being granted permission to a resource through assignment to any other role.

To view the list of SIDs of accounts that are refused membership in this application group in text form, use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/43bdd205-4750-4ff6-8063-8de2c5962b09">NonMembers</a> property.

You must call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/51a855dd-4a90-4f7a-b32f-f91e3941655b">Submit</a> method to persist any changes made by this method.
