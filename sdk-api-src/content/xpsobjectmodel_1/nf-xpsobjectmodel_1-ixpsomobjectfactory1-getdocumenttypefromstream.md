# IXpsOMObjectFactory1::GetDocumentTypeFromStream


## -description


Detects the type of XPS document that is stored in the specified stream.


## -parameters




### -param xpsDocumentStream

[in] A stream that contains XPS OM data. The stream must support sequential reading and the read position of the stream must be set to the beginning of the XPS data.


### -param documentType

[out, retval] The document type of the XPS data found in the stream.


## -returns



Possible values include, but are not limited to, the following. For information about XPS document API return values that are not listed here, see XPS Document Errors.

S_OK: The document type is XPS_DOCUMENT_TYPE_ XPS or XPS_DOCUMENT_TYPE_ OPENXPS. 




## -remarks



This method only parses the data enough to detect the document type. It does not validate the content. A return value of S_OK does not, therefore, imply that the stream contains a valid document.
