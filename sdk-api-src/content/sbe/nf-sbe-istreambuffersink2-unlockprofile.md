## -parameters

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">

<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>

## -remarks



The filter graph must be stopped when you call this method. If the recording session has not been started, this method invalidates the recording. To re-create the recording, call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9e694cc2-090e-43b1-88c7-77175a930bf1">IStreamBufferSink::LockProfile</a> again. If the profile is not already locked, the <b>UnlockProfile</b> method has no effect and returns S_FALSE.

If the graph is running, stopping the graph automatically unlocks the profile without the need to call <b>UnlockProfile</b>.
