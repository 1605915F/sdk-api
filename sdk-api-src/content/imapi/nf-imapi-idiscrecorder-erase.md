# IDiscRecorder::Erase


## -description


Attempts to erase the CD-RW media if this is a CD-RW disc recorder. Both full and quick erases are supported.


## -parameters




### -param bFullErase [in]

Indicates the erase type. If this parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, a quick erase is performed. If this parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, a full erase is performed.


## -returns



S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:




## -remarks



Erasing a disc can be a very lengthy operation (sometimes in excess of an hour). To receive an erase completion notification, use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/17a0debe-919d-4db7-bcbb-eb4fc9973d83">IDiscMasterProgressEvents::NotifyEraseComplete</a>.

The quick option erases only the PMA, first session TOC, and the pre-gap of the first track. This erases a disc quickly (between 1 and 2 minutes depending on recorder speed), but the program area will still contain user data. A full erase, on the other hand, erases the entire disc.
