This method can return standard <b>HRESULT</b> values, such as 
      <b>E_INVALIDARG</b> or <b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b>, and 
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c9ddd3b7-f017-4880-976a-c879a40dc17b">VDS-specific return values</a>.

## -remarks



By default, the registry retains the drive-letter mapping information for uninstalled volumes. If the disk 
    that contains the volume is removed from the computer, the registry entry is retained, so that if the disk and 
    volume return to the same computer, the volume receives the same drive letter. If the disk is moved to a new 
    computer, the registry entries do not move with it, so the volume might receive a different drive letter and 
    volume GUID.

The 
    <b>CleanupObsoleteMountPoints</b> 
    method removes these registry entries. There are three types of registry entries that are removed:

<ul>
<li>If the volume does not have a drive letter or a volume GUID, it has a "no drive letter" 
      registry entry, which is removed by this method.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the volume has registry entries for a volume GUID and possibly a drive letter. Both are removed 
      by this method.</li>
</ul>
In addition, if the volume contains any mounted folders, 
    <b>CleanupObsoleteMountPoints</b> 
    removes them. For example, if <i>Volume1</i> on <i>Disk1</i> is being 
    removed and <i>Volume1</i> is mounted as 
    <i>x</i>:\<i>MountVolume1</i> on <i>Disk2</i>, the 
    \<i>MountVolume1</i> folder on <i>Disk2</i> is also deleted.
