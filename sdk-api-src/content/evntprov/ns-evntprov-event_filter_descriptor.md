# EVENT_FILTER_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The EVENT_FILTER_DESCRIPTOR structure supplements the event provider, level, and keyword data that determines which events are reported and traced. The EVENT_FILTER_DESCRIPTOR structure gives the event provider greater control over the selection of events for reporting and tracing. 


## -struct-fields




### -field Ptr

A pointer to the filter data. 


### -field Size

The size of the filter data, in bytes. The maximum size is 1024 bytes.


### -field Type

The type of filter data. The type is application-defined. An event controller  that knows about the provider and knows details about the provider's events can use the <b>Type</b> field to send the provider an arbitrary set of data for use as enhancements to the filtering of events.


## -remarks



You pass a pointer to the EVENT_FILTER_DESCRIPTOR structure when you create the optional driver-supplied <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5953a3ae-b130-42fd-9dc8-974d15c6dfc5">EtwEnableCallback</a>function. When you register the driver with ETW, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/89a37edb-0f58-45c2-9045-b31eec5a4281">EtwRegister</a> function takes a pointer to the <b>EtwEnableCallback</b> function as a parameter.
