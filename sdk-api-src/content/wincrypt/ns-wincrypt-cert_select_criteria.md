# CERT_SELECT_CRITERIA structure


## -description


The <b>CERT_SELECT_CRITERIA</b> structure specifies selection criteria that is passed to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b740772b-d25b-4b3d-9acb-03f7018750d6">CertSelectCertificateChains</a> function.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwType

Specifies the type of selection criteria used for the <b>ppPara</b> member. This member can have one of the following values.

Select certificates  based on  a specific <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f1caccd2-3453-448e-b194-bf899eff8091">enhanced key usage</a>. When this flag is set, the <i>ppPara</i> must reference a null-terminated <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e6be8932-015e-4058-b249-1671b3fea521">object identifier</a> (OID) ANSI string that specifies the enhanced key usage.

This criteria is evaluated on the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/db46def4-bfdc-4801-a57d-d568e94a2dbb">certificate</a>.
