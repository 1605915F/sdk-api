# tagMONCONVSTRUCT structure


## -description


Contains information about a Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) conversation. A DDE monitoring application can use this structure to obtain information about a conversation that has been established or has terminated. 


## -struct-fields




### -field cb

Type: <b>UINT</b>

The structure's size, in bytes. 


### -field fConnect

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Indicates whether the conversation is currently established. A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates the conversation is established; <b>FALSE</b> indicates it is not. 


### -field dwTime

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The Windows time at which the conversation was established or terminated. Windows time is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system was booted. 


### -field hTask

Type: <b>HANDLE</b>

A handle to a task (application instance) that is a partner in the conversation. 


### -field hszSvc

Type: <b>HSZ</b>

A handle to the service name on which the conversation is established. 


### -field hszTopic

Type: <b>HSZ</b>

A handle to the topic name on which the conversation is established. 


### -field hConvClient

Type: <b>HCONV</b>

A handle to the client conversation. 


### -field hConvServer

Type: <b>HCONV</b>

A handle to the server conversation. 


## -remarks



Because string handles are local to the process, the <b>hszSvc</b> and <b>hszTopic</b> members are global atoms. Similarly, conversation handles are local to the instance; therefore, the <b>hConvClient</b> and <b>hConvServer</b> members are window handles. 

The <b>hConvClient</b> and <b>hConvServer</b> members of the <b>MONCONVSTRUCT</b> structure do not hold the same value as would be seen by the applications engaged in the conversation. Instead, they hold a globally unique pair of values that identify the conversation.
