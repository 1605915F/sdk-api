## -struct-fields




### -field pointerId

The ID of the pointer. You cannot pass this value to the input message process and  retrieve additional pointer info through <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/75faea24-91cd-448b-b67a-19fe530f1800">GetPointerInfo</a>. 


### -field point

The screen coordinates of the touch point that the touch digitizer reports.


### -field boundingBox

The bounding rectangle of the touch contact area. Valid touch targets are identified and scored based on this bounding box. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This bounding box may differ from the contact area that the digitizer reports when:
<ul>
<li>The digitizer reports a touch contact area that's outside the maximum or minimum size threshold that's recognized by  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bdd7630c-b2d8-4080-a149-efec018f697d">Touch Hit Testing</a>.</li>
<li>A portion of the touch contact area is occluded by another object that's higher in the z-order.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div> </div>

### -field nonOccludedBoundingBox

The touch contact area within a specific targeted window that's not occluded by other objects that are higher in the z-order. Any area that's occluded by another object is an invalid target.
