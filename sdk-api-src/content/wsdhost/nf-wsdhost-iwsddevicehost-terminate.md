## -remarks



Services and notification sinks will not receive messages after the <b>Terminate</b> method has completed.

If this device host was started by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/06fea296-2551-46b1-9cd7-54187bca5fe8">IWSDDeviceHost::Start</a>, it must first be stopped by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7a31e45a-7d38-44b7-84c7-7471bc14cc94">IWSDDeviceHost::Stop</a> before <b>Terminate</b> can be called.

	<b>Terminate</b> must be called before releasing the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/497d0331-c88d-4381-8990-94227a9b9659">IWSDDeviceHost</a>.
