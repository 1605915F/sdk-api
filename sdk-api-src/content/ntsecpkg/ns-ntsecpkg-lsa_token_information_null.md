# LSA_TOKEN_INFORMATION_NULL structure


## -description


The <b>LSA_TOKEN_INFORMATION_NULL</b> structure is used in cases where a non-authenticated system access is needed.

For example, a non-authentication network circuit (such as a null session) can be given <b>NULL</b> information. This results in an anonymous token being generated for the logon. An anonymous token gives the user no ability to access protected system resources, but does allow access to non-protected system resources.


## -struct-fields




### -field ExpirationTime

Time at which the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3e9d7672-2314-45c8-8178-5a0afcfd0c50">security context</a> becomes not valid. Use a value in the distant future if the context never expires.


### -field Groups


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/387dd7f8-4177-40fa-b5fd-bb4b371a0e64">TOKEN_GROUPS</a> structure containing the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3e9d7672-2314-45c8-8178-5a0afcfd0c50">security identifiers</a> (SIDs) of groups the user is to be made a member of. This should not include WORLD or other SIDs defined and assigned by the system. 




Each SID is expected to be in a separately allocated block of memory. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/387dd7f8-4177-40fa-b5fd-bb4b371a0e64">TOKEN_GROUPS</a> structure is also expected to be in a separately allocated block of memory.
