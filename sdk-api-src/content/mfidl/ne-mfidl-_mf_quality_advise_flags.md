# _MF_QUALITY_ADVISE_FLAGS enumeration


## -description


Contains flags for the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7e39d421-1e7c-4b6d-beba-e24429271378">IMFQualityAdvise2::NotifyQualityEvent</a> method.


## -enum-fields




### -field MF_QUALITY_CANNOT_KEEP_UP

The decoder has done everything that it can to reduce sample latency, and samples are still late.


## -remarks



If the decoder sets the <b>MF_QUALITY_CANNOT_KEEP_UP</b> flag, the quality manager tries to reduce latency through the media source and the media sink. For example, it might request the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1c985558-d25d-4f51-978a-58c05943dab9">Enhanced Video Renderer</a> (EVR) to drop frames. During this period, the quality manager stops calling the decoder's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7e39d421-1e7c-4b6d-beba-e24429271378">IMFQualityAdvise2::NotifyQualityEvent</a> method, until samples are no longer arriving late at the sink. At that point, the quality manager resumes calling <b>NotifyQualityEvent</b> on the decoder.
