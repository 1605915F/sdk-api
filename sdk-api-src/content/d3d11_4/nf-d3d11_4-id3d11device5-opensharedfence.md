# ID3D11Device5::OpenSharedFence


## -description


Opens a handle for a shared fence by using HANDLE and REFIID.

This member function is a limited version of the Direct3D 12 <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4F428B06-2906-4ED6-BB75-5DACF2155FA9">ID3D12Device::OpenSharedHandle</a> member function, and applies between Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12 in interop scenarios. Unlike <b>ID3D12Device::OpenSharedHandle</b> which operates on resources, heaps, and fences, the <b>ID3D11Device5::OpenSharedFence</b> function only operates on fences; in Direct3D 11, shared resources are opened with the <a href="direct3d11.id3d11device_opensharedresource1">ID3D11Device::OpenSharedResource1</a> member function.
