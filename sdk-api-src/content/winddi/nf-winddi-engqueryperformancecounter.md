# EngQueryPerformanceCounter function


## -description


The <b>EngQueryPerformanceCounter</b> function queries the performance counter.


## -parameters




### -param pPerformanceCount [out]

Pointer to a location that receives the performance counter value, in hertz.


## -returns

## -remarks



<b>EngQueryPerformanceCounter</b> always returns a 64-bit integer that represents the number of ticks per second. The count begins accumulating when the system is booted.
