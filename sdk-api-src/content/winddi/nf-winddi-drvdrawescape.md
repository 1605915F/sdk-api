# DrvDrawEscape function


## -description


The <b>DrvDrawEscape</b> function is the entry point that serves more than one function call; the particular function depends on the value of the <i>iEsc</i> parameter. 


## -parameters




### -param pso [in]

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cee7cb50-1e8a-422b-aebe-7030ae96fb34">SURFOBJ</a> structure that identifies the surface to which the call is directed.


### -param iEsc [in]

Specifies the operation to be performed. The meanings of the remaining parameters depend on this parameter. This parameter can be the following value. 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ESC_PASSTHROUGH

</td>
<td>
Passes raw device data to the device driver. The number of bytes of raw data is indicated by <i>cjIn</i>. The data is pointed to by <i>pvIn</i>. The return value is the number of bytes written if the function is successful. Otherwise, it is zero, and an error code is logged.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param pco [in]

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c3f632ed-f8d1-44bb-b2fb-6f7f2c71fd63">CLIPOBJ</a> structure that can be queried to find the area on the surface that the caller can overwrite.


### -param prcl [in]

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/709f8262-829e-4cda-bb0b-564307edfd24">RECTL</a> structure that defines the window rectangle on the surface. The application does not know the position of the window on the surface. GDI supplies this rectangle and holds a lock that ensures the rectangle is stable for the duration of the call. Coordinates received from the application are relative to the upper left corner of the window rectangle.


### -param cjIn [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pvIn</i>.


### -param pvIn [in]

Pointer to the input data for the call. The format of the input data depends on the function specified by <i>iEsc</i>.


## -returns



The return value depends on the function specified by <i>iEsc</i>. The driver should return 0xFFFFFFFF if an unsupported function is called.




## -remarks



This entry point differs from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7b59dc85-27f4-4529-847e-6027dae8a45a">DrvEscape</a> in that a CLIPOBJ structure is provided. This allows a driver to implement its own <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7c1489c9-40de-4b44-95b7-af227c7d8205">drawing functions</a> in a windowed environment.

GDI passes data directly from a (possibly malicious) client application to the driver, which means that the <b>DrvDrawEscape</b> function must validate all input arguments. Specifically, this function must:

<ul>
<li>
Verify that the value received in the <i>iEsc</i> parameter represents a valid query.

</li>
<li>
Verify that the size of the input buffer (the value in the <i>cjIn</i> parameter) is valid for the specified query. 

</li>
<li>
Verify that the contents of the buffer pointed to by the <i>pvIn</i> parameter are valid for the specified query.

</li>
</ul>
The escapes that a device supports are determined by a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7b59dc85-27f4-4529-847e-6027dae8a45a">DrvEscape</a>.

For more information about the escape codes that Microsoft reserves, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7b59dc85-27f4-4529-847e-6027dae8a45a">DrvEscape</a>.

<b>DrvDrawEscape</b> is optional for all drivers.
