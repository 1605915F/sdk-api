## -remarks



In addition to managing the common two, three, and four channel color spaces, WCS 1.0 is able to perform color management with device profiles that contain five through eight <a href="c.htm">color channels</a>. It is also able to use named color spaces. When five, six, seven, or eight color channels are used, the provider of the device profile is free to determine what the color channels represent. The same is true of named color spaces. WCS 1.0 is able to manage these color spaces as long as there is a mapping in the device profile that maps the channels or the name space into the <a href="p.htm">PCS</a>. The device profile must also contain a mapping from the PCS into the five, size, seven, or eight channel space, or into the named color space.
