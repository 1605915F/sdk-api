# IWTSPlugin interface


## -description


Allows for the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client plug-in to be loaded by the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client. The interface is implemented by the plug-in, and is obtained by and managed by the RDC client.

The RDC client obtains an instance of this interface by either instantiating the COM object, or by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B81BD61E-1F43-42C9-8839-30F4F4C3973C">VirtualChannelGetInstance</a> function implemented by the plug-in. For more information about how the instances are obtained, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cda4f8c9-867a-41ac-894a-4296d5912b2b">DVC plug-in registration</a>. In all cases, this instance is kept for the lifetime of the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client.

As a COM object, the plug-in must be implemented in a free-threading model. Because the <b>IWTSPlugin</b> methods are implemented by the plug-in, the plug-in must be aware that the call may arrive on different threads. The calls will always arrive serially, so it is impossible to have any two calls that are executed in parallel.

Implementation should not block these calls because this may block other incoming connections or data on existing connections.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWTSPlugin</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWTSPlugin</b> also has these types of members:
