# ID3D11DeviceContext2::EndEvent


## -description


Allows applications to annotate the end of a range of graphics commands.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method does not return a value.




## -remarks



<b>EndEvent</b> allows applications to annotate the end of a range of graphics commands, in order to provide more context to what the GPU is executing. When the appropriate <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms751538(v=VS.85).aspx">ETW</a> logging is not enabled, this method does nothing. When ETW logging is enabled, an additional marker is correlated between the CPU and GPU timelines.
