# _WSD_CONFIG_ADDRESSES structure


## -description


Information about specific addresses that a host should listen on.


## -struct-fields




### -field addresses

An array of pointers to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b19938b2-2fba-42fe-8c4e-5696c40acd58">IWSDAddress</a> interfaces.

If <i>pszLocalId</i> contains a logical address, the resulting behavior is a mapping between the logical address and a specific set of physical addresses (instead of a mapping between the logical address and a default physical address).


### -field dwAddressCount

The number of items in the <b>addresses</b> array.
