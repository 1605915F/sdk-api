# IWbemClassObject::GetMethodOrigin


## -description


The 
<b>IWbemClassObject::GetMethodOrigin</b> method is used to determine the class for which a method was declared.

This call is only supported if the current object is a CIM class definition. Method manipulation is not available from 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a3ce37d7-5580-4b84-9119-78412c8e0d27">IWbemClassObject</a> pointers which point to CIM instances.


## -parameters




### -param wszMethodName [in]

Name of the method for the object whose owning class is being requested.


### -param pstrClassName [out]

Receives the name of the class which owns the method. The user must call <b>SysFreeString </b>on the returned <i>BSTR</i> when it is no longer required.


## -returns



This method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> indicating the status of the method call. The following list lists the value contained within an <b>HRESULT</b>. For general <b>HRESULT</b> values, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4a3a8feb-a05f-4614-8f04-1f507da7e5b7">System Error Codes</a>.




## -remarks



Because methods are inherited from class to class, it is often desirable to determine the owning class for a given method.
