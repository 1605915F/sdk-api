## -remarks



An application can store the value of this property prior to making a change to the file system, then at a later point pass the value to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/852b88ed-6af7-4fe6-bf5f-831d55423130">IFileSystemImage::RollbackToChangePoint</a> method to revert changes since that point in development.

An application can call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ae5d659c-5da7-4478-b65f-64cbe227dbc5">IFileSystemImage::LockInChangePoint</a> method to lock the state of  a file system image at any point in its development. Once a lock is set, you cannot call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/852b88ed-6af7-4fe6-bf5f-831d55423130">RollbackToChangePoint</a> to revert the file system image to its earlier state.
