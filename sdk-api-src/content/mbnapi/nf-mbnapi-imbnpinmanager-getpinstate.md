## -remarks



The <b>GetPinState</b> method initiates an asynchronous request for the PIN state of the device. The PIN state indicates if a PIN needs to be entered for a requested operation to complete. It also contains information about which type of PIN is expected by a device and optionally it provides the number of attempts remaining for entering a valid PIN.

This method always returns the current PIN state of the device. It does not cache the PIN state at the time when this object is created.  Instead it always contacts the device and returns the current PIN state of the device.

Since this is an asynchronous operation, <b>GetPinState</b> will return immediately. On completion of the operation, the Mobile Broadband service will call the   <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e228073b-896a-4d2d-a8a5-f8fa7a52ffc2">OnGetPinStateComplete</a> method of  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2942bd4d-5bdb-45eb-a008-352bf44eec80">IMbnPinManagerEvents</a>.

Whenever an operation returns <b>E_MBN_PIN_REQUIRED</b> or the ready state reported by the device is <b>MBN_READY_STATE_DEVICE_LOCKED</b>, an application should use this method to query the type of PIN required to unlock the device or SIM.

While this operation is in progress,  if the Mobile Broadband device gets removed from the system then a call to the   <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e228073b-896a-4d2d-a8a5-f8fa7a52ffc2">OnGetPinStateComplete</a> method of  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2942bd4d-5bdb-45eb-a008-352bf44eec80">IMbnPinManagerEvents</a> is not guaranteed.
