# TraceLoggingWriteTagged macro


## -description


Logs an event with an associated ETW activity id.

The activity must have been started, and must not have been stopped yet.


## -parameters




### -param activity [in]

The activity that this method will use to tag the event.


### -param name [in]

The name of the event. This must be a string literal and not a variable. It cannot have any embedded nul characters.


#### - args [in, optional]

Additional parameters added to the event. The maximum number of optional parameters is 99. All parameters must be wrapper macros as defined in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/806F43F3-D376-4DBD-A4C5-B5F01E5D009D">TraceLogging Wrapper Macros</a>.

<b>TraceLoggingWriteTagged</b> does not use the activity’s level or keyword – the default level is 5 (verbose) and the default keyword is 0 (none). Unlike with <b>TraceLoggingWriteStart</b> and <b>TraceLoggingWriteStop</b>, it is ok to use <b>TraceLoggingLevel</b> and <b>TraceLoggingKeyword</b> as args here.
