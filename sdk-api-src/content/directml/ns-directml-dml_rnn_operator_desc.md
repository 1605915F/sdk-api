# DML_RNN_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description






Describes a DirectML deep learning operator that performs a one-layer simple recurrent neural network (RNN) function on the input, Y = Activation(clip( X * Transpose(W) + Initial_h * Transpose(R) + b)).


## -struct-fields




### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from, X. Packed (and potentially padded) into one 3-D tensor with the shape of [seq_length, batch_size, input_size].


### -field WeightTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the weight tensor for the gates, W. Concatenation of Wi and WBi (if bidirectional). The tensor has shape [num_directions, hidden_size, input_size].


### -field RecurrenceTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the recurrence weight tensor, R. Concatenation of Ri and RBi (if bidirectional). This tensor has shape [num_directions, hidden_size, hidden_size].


### -field BiasTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the bias tensor for the input gate, B. Concatenation of [Wbi, Rbi], and [WBbi, RBbi] (if bidirectional). This tensor has shape [num_directions, 2 * hidden_size]. If not specified, then defaults to 0.


### -field HiddenInitTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the hidden node initializer tensor, H. If not specified, then defaults to 0. This tensor has shape [num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size].


### -field SequenceLengthsTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the lengths of the sequences in a batch. If not specified, then all sequences in the batch have length seq_length. This tensor has shape [batch_size].


### -field OutputSequenceTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to which to write the concatenation of all the intermediate output values of the hidden nodes.  This tensor has shape [seq_length, num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size].


### -field OutputSingleTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to which to write the last output value of the hidden nodes.  This tensor has shape [num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size].


### -field ActivationDescCount

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

This field determines the size of the <i>ActivationDescs</i> array.


### -field ActivationDescs

Type: **const [DML_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_operator_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant array of [DML_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_operator_desc) containing the descriptions of the activation operators.


### -field Direction

Type: **const [DML_RECURRENT_NETWORK_DIRECTION](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_recurrent_network_direction)\***

The direction of the operatorâ€”forward, reverse, or bidirectional. You can use a default value of <b>DML_RECURRENT_NETWORK_DIRECTION_FORWARD</b>.
