# DML_GRU_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description






Describes a DirectML deep learning operator that performs a (standard layers) one-layer gated recurrent unit (GRU) function on the input.

Z = Activation1(clip( X * transpose(W1) + Initial_h1 * transpose(R1) + b1))

R = Activation1(clip( X * transpose(W2) + Initial_h1 * transpose(R2) + b2))

C = Initial_h1 .* R

O = Activation2(clip( X * transpose(W3) + Initial_h1 * transpose(R3) + b3))

Y = (1-Z) .* O + Z .* Initial_h1

(W = [W1, W2, W3]; b1 = B[0, :] + B[3*hidden_size]; b2 = B[1, :] + B[4*hidden_size, :]; b3 = B[2, :] + B[4*hidden_size, :];)
