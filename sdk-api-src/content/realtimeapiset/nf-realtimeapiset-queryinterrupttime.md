# QueryInterruptTime function


## -description


Gets the current interrupt-time count. For a more precise count, use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0F65A707-0899-4F79-B7CD-16C9143C4173">QueryInterruptTimePrecise</a>.


## -parameters




### -param lpInterruptTime [out]

A pointer to a ULONGLONG in which to receive the interrupt-time count in system time units of 100 nanoseconds. Divide by ten million, or 1e7, to get seconds (there are 1e9 nanoseconds in a second, so there are 1e7 100-nanoseconds in a second).


## -returns



This function does not return a value.




## -remarks



The interrupt-time count begins at zero when the system starts and is incremented at each clock interrupt by the length of a clock tick. The exact length of a clock tick depends on underlying hardware and can vary between systems.

Unlike system time, the interrupt-time count is not subject to adjustments by users or the Windows time service. Applications can use the interrupt-time count to measure finer durations than are possible with system time. Applications that require greater precision than the interrupt-time count should use a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms644900(v=VS.85).aspx">high-resolution timer</a>. Use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644905(v=VS.85).aspx">QueryPerformanceFrequency</a> function to retrieve the frequency of the high-resolution timer and the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644904(v=VS.85).aspx">QueryPerformanceCounter</a> function to retrieve the counter's value.

The  timer resolution set by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7168981c-9af8-4665-88a2-7d96a8f2b273">timeBeginPeriod</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b06531f9-4fd7-4051-80d4-5a175fdd37e7">timeEndPeriod</a> functions affects the resolution of  the <b>QueryInterruptTime</b> function. However, increasing the timer resolution is not recommended because it can reduce overall system performance and   increase system power consumption by preventing the processor from entering power-saving states. Instead, applications should use a high-resolution timer.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <b>QueryInterruptTime</b> function produces different results on debug ("checked") builds of Windows, because the interrupt-time count and tick count are advanced by approximately 49 days. This helps to identify bugs that might not occur until the system has been running for a long time. The checked build is available to MSDN subscribers through the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=8714">Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)</a> Web site.</div>

To compile an application that uses this function, define _WIN32_WINNT as 0x0601 or later. For more information, see
