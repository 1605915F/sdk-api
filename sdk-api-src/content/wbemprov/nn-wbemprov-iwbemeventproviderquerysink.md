# IWbemEventProviderQuerySink interface


## -description


The 
<b>IWbemEventProviderQuerySink</b> interface is optionally implemented by event providers who want to know what kinds of event query filters are currently active to optimize performance.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWbemEventProviderQuerySink</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWbemEventProviderQuerySink</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IWbemEventProviderQuerySink</b> interface has these methods.
<table class="members" id="memberListMethods">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="37%">Method</th>
<th align="left" width="63%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr data="declared;">
<td align="left" width="37%">
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fdb56ea9-bd1a-436e-aaa7-3ae11e10f38e">CancelQuery</a>
</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Called whenever a consumer query is canceled or unregistered.

</td>
</tr>
<tr data="declared;">
<td align="left" width="37%">
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/82f76b19-2035-4567-b619-31ce8a35e422">NewQuery</a>
</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Called whenever a new consumer query is registered with WMI.

</td>
</tr>
</table> 


## -remarks



Although WMI calls the methods of 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4b92923a-659d-4340-8843-eb42aea69d47">IWbemEventProvider</a> only one time after an event provider becomes active, WMI calls the methods of 
<b>IWbemEventProviderQuerySink</b> continuously, as appropriate. The provider can ignore all calls to 
<b>IWbemEventProviderQuerySink</b> methods as needed. This point is very important; supporting 
<b>IWbemEventProviderQuerySink</b> indicates that a provider will supply at least the events requested by queries.

A provider can also generate more events than requested, which WMI filters as appropriate. This functionality means you can implement 
<b>IWbemEventProviderQuerySink</b> and optimize processing without addressing all parts of the WMI Query Language (WQL). For instance, if a provider does not specifically handle a particular query, the provider can generate all possible events for the query.
