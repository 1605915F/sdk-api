# SP_DEVINFO_DATA structure


## -description


An SP_DEVINFO_DATA structure defines a device instance that is a member of a device information set.


## -struct-fields




### -field cbSize

The size, in bytes, of the SP_DEVINFO_DATA structure. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


### -field ClassGuid

The GUID of the device's setup class.


### -field DevInst

An opaque handle to the device instance (also known as a handle to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/86688b5d-575d-42e1-9158-7ffba1aaf1d3">devnode</a>). 

Some functions, such as <b>SetupDi</b><i>Xxx</i> functions, take the whole SP_DEVINFO_DATA structure as input to identify a device in a device information set. Other functions, such as <b>CM</b>_<i>Xxx</i> functions like <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7347c142-8bcf-43b3-aef0-5f99e2873560">CM_Get_DevNode_Status</a>, take this <b>DevInst</b> handle as input.


### -field Reserved

Reserved. For internal use only.


## -remarks



An SP_DEVINFO_DATA structure identifies a device in a device information set. For example, when Windows sends a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2d369086-c2b6-45a4-a87e-51ff5725938f">DIF_INSTALLDEVICE</a> request to a class installer and co-installers, it includes a handle to a device information set and a pointer to an SP_DEVINFO_DATA that specifies the particular device. In addition to DIF requests, this structure is also used in some <b>SetupDi</b><i>Xxx</i> functions.

<b>SetupDi</b><i>Xxx</i> functions that take an SP_DEVINFO_DATA structure as a parameter verify that the <b>cbSize</b> member of the supplied structure is equal to the size, in bytes, of the structure. If the <b>cbSize</b> member is not set correctly for an input parameter, the function will fail and set an error code of ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. If the <b>cbSize</b> member is not set correctly for an output parameter, the function will fail and set an error code of ERROR_INVALID_USER_BUFFER.
