<th>Description
                </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No flag set</td>
<td>None of the conditions for the other flags applies. For example, a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757828(v=VS.85).aspx">delta frame</a> in most cases would not have any flags set for it.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>WM_SF_DISCONTINUITY</td>
<td>The data stream has a gap in it, which could be due to a seek, a network loss, or some other reason. This can be useful extra information for an application such as a codec or renderer. The flag is set on the first piece of data following the gap.</td>
</tr>

<td>WM_SF_DATALOSS</td>
<td>Some data has been lost between the previous sample and the sample with this flag set.</td>
