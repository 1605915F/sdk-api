# PEER_OBJECT structure


## -description


The <b>PEER_OBJECT</b> structure contains application-specific run-time information that can be shared with trusted contacts within a peer collaboration network.


## -struct-fields




### -field id

GUID value under which the peer object is uniquely registered.


### -field data


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d8a8b9e3-c455-4813-b812-263efe7f5e3e">PEER_DATA</a> structure that contains information which describes the peer object.


### -field dwPublicationScope


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fecb9403-f790-4955-a879-fb3e6fbfe8ca">PEER_PUBLICATION_SCOPE</a> enumeration value that specifies the publication scope for this peer object.


## -remarks



Peer objects are run-time data items associated with a particular application, such as a picture or avatar, a certificate, or a specific description. Each peer object must be smaller than 16K in size.

Trusted contacts watching this peer object will have a PEER_EVENT_OBJECT_CHANGED event raised on them signaling this peer object's change in status.

Peer object information is contained in the <b>data</b> member of this structure and  represented as a byte buffer with a maximum size of 16K.

The lifetime of a peer object is tied to the lifetime of the application that registered it.
