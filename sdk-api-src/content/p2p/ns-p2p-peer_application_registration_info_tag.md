### -field dwPublicationScope


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fecb9403-f790-4955-a879-fb3e6fbfe8ca">PEER_PUBLICATION_SCOPE</a> enumeration value that specifies the publication scope for this application registration information. The only valid value for this member is PEER_PUBLICATION_SCOPE_INTERNET.


## -remarks



An "application" is a set of software or software  components available on the peer's endpoint. Commonly, this refers to software packages that support peer networking activities, like games or other collaborative applications.

A peer application has a GUID representing a single specific application. When an application is registered for a peer, this GUID and the corresponding application can be made available to all trusted contacts of the peer, indicating the activities the peer can participate in. To deregister a peer's application, call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2479b726-20f1-4370-9fcf-f29cec44c3ec">PeerCollabUnregisterApplication</a> with this GUID.
