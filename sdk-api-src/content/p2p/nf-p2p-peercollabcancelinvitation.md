## -remarks



 When <b>PeerCollabCancelInvitation</b> is called, depending on the state of the invitation, it will perform one or more of the following actions:


<ul>
<li>If the connection to the receiver is not yet established, it will cancel the connection creation process and the receiver will not see the invitation.</li>
<li>If the invitation has been received, but not responded to, it will notify the recipient contact that the invitation has been canceled. As a result, the receiver will not be able to respond to the invitation.</li>
<li>If the receiver has already responded to the invitation, the call performs a no-op.
After canceling the invitation, you must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fbcf65c7-a133-44b9-b5bb-309b1c257a90">PeerCollabCloseHandle</a>.
</li>
</ul>
