# GetTickCount function


## -description


Retrieves the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system was started, up to 49.7 days.


## -parameters






## -returns



The return value is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system was started.




## -remarks



The resolution of the <b>GetTickCount</b> function is limited to the resolution of the system timer, which is typically in the range of  10 milliseconds to 16 milliseconds. The resolution of the <b>GetTickCount</b> function is not affected by adjustments made by the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6c748726-c81d-4669-87a1-28aad0fccead">GetSystemTimeAdjustment</a> function.

The elapsed time is stored as a <b>DWORD</b> value. Therefore, the time will wrap around to zero if the system is run continuously for 49.7 days. To avoid this problem, use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3ebf05b9-cc53-43ae-bbcb-7841793a9d84">GetTickCount64</a> function. Otherwise, check for an overflow condition when comparing times.

If you need a higher resolution timer, use a 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/25e0b313-64ff-4f30-ae0a-ac364ce3f0cf">multimedia timer</a> or a 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms644900(v=VS.85).aspx">high-resolution timer</a>.

To obtain the time elapsed since the computer was started, retrieve the System Up Time counter in the performance data in the registry key <b>HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA</b>. The value returned is an 8-byte value. For more information, see 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9dcb7e84-a7d6-43b5-8fe9-4e33d683c74c">Performance Counters</a>. 

To obtain the time the system has spent in the working state since it was started, use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f9cf5440-9be9-4ff9-b85c-2779b847954c">QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime</a> function.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f9cf5440-9be9-4ff9-b85c-2779b847954c">QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime</a> function produces different results on debug ("checked") builds of Windows, because the interrupt-time count and tick count are advanced by approximately 49 days. This helps to identify bugs that might not occur until the system has been running for a long time. The checked build is available to MSDN subscribers through the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)</a> Web site.</div>
