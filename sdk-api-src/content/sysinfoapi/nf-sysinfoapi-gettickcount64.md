# GetTickCount64 function


## -description


Retrieves the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system was started.


## -parameters






## -returns



The number of milliseconds.




## -remarks



The resolution of the <b>GetTickCount64</b> function is limited to the resolution of the system timer, which is typically in the range of  10 milliseconds to 16 milliseconds. The resolution of the <b>GetTickCount64</b> function is not affected by adjustments made by the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6c748726-c81d-4669-87a1-28aad0fccead">GetSystemTimeAdjustment</a> function.

If you need a higher resolution timer, use a 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/25e0b313-64ff-4f30-ae0a-ac364ce3f0cf">multimedia timer</a> or a 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms644900(v=VS.85).aspx">high-resolution timer</a>.

To obtain the time the system has spent in the working state since it was started, use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f9cf5440-9be9-4ff9-b85c-2779b847954c">QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime</a> function. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f9cf5440-9be9-4ff9-b85c-2779b847954c">QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime</a> function produces different results on debug ("checked") builds of Windows, because the interrupt-time count and tick count are advanced by approximately 49 days. This helps to identify bugs that might not occur until the system has been running for a long time. The checked build is available to MSDN subscribers through the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)</a> Web site.</div>

To compile an application that uses this function, define _WIN32_WINNT as 0x0600 or later. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a4def563-8ddc-4630-ae8a-86c07cf98374">Using the Windows Headers</a>.
