# IFaxInboundRoutingMethod::get_Priority


## -description


The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686150(v=VS.85).aspx">Priority</a> property is a value associated with the order in which the fax service calls the routing method when the service receives a fax job.

This property is read/write.


## -parameters


## -remarks



Valid values for this property are 1 through <i>n</i>, where 1 is the highest priority.

You should assign a unique priority value to each routing method. After you call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684815(v=VS.85).aspx">IFaxInboundRoutingMethod::Save</a> method, the fax service sorts the routing methods by priority. If two routing methods have the same priority, the fax service will choose which will have a higher priority.

If you want a particular routing method to have the lowest possible priority, specify a very large value, such as 999999, and then call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684815(v=VS.85).aspx">IFaxInboundRoutingMethod::Save</a> method.

To read or to write to this property, a user must have the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms689205(v=VS.85).aspx">farQUERY_CONFIG</a> access right.
