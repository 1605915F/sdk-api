# IFaxOutboundRoutingGroup interface


## -description


The <b>IFaxOutboundRoutingGroup</b> interface describes a configuration object that is used by a fax client application to retrieve information about an individual fax outbound routing group. The object also includes a method to retrieve the ordered collection of device IDs (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686503(v=VS.85).aspx">IFaxDeviceIds</a> interfaces) that participate in the routing group. The order of the devices in the collection determines the relative order in which available devices send outgoing transmissions.
		


## -remarks



A default implementation of <b>IFaxOutboundRoutingGroup</b> is provided as the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms689098(v=VS.85).aspx">FaxOutboundRoutingGroup</a> object.
