# IDeviceModelPlugIn::Initialize


## -description


Takes a pointer to a Stream that contains the whole device model plug-in as input, and initializes any internal parameters required by the plug-in.


## -parameters




### -param bstrXml [in]

A string that contains the BSTR XML device model plug-in profile. This parameter stores data as little-endian Unicode XML; however, it may have no leading bytes to tag it as such. Also, the encoding keyword in the XML may not reflect that this is formatted as little-endian Unicode. Furthermore, due to the action of the MSXML engine, the BSTR XML file is processed and might not have exactly the same contents as the original XML file.


### -param cNumModels [in]

The number of total models in the transform sequence.


### -param iModelPosition [in]

The one-based model position of the other device model in the workflow of <i>uiNumModels</i> as provided in the <b>Initialize</b> function.


## -returns



If this function succeeds, the return value is S_OK.

If this function fails, the return value is E_FAIL.




## -remarks



If this function is called more than once, subsequent calls release any allocated memory and reinitialize according to the new <i>bstrXml</i> parameter.
