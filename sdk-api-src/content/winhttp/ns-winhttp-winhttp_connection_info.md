# WINHTTP_CONNECTION_INFO structure


## -description


The <b>WINHTTP_CONNECTION_INFO</b> structure contains the source and destination IP address of the request that generated the response.


## -struct-fields




### -field cbSize

The size, in bytes, of the <b>WINHTTP_CONNECTION_INFO</b> structure.


### -field LocalAddress

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dfd84b91-0a94-4fe6-b8d2-18562afb9c24">SOCKADDR_STORAGE</a> structure that contains the local IP address and port of the original request.


### -field RemoteAddress

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dfd84b91-0a94-4fe6-b8d2-18562afb9c24">SOCKADDR_STORAGE</a> structure that contains the remote IP address and port of the original request.


## -remarks



When <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0b79e73b-9f6a-42eb-9108-1ba142ad7c48">WinHttpReceiveResponse</a> returns, the application can retrieve the source and destination IP address of the request that generated the response. The application calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/47973eab-de70-47bf-9713-97b87a500cfa">WinHttpQueryOption</a> with the <b>WINHTTP_OPTION_CONNECTION_INFO</b> option, and provides the <b>WINHTTP_CONNECTION_INFO</b> structure in the <i>lpBuffer</i> parameter.


#### Examples

The following code example shows the call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/47973eab-de70-47bf-9713-97b87a500cfa">WinHttpQueryOption</a>. Winsock2.h must be included before Winhttp.h when using the <b>WINHTTP_OPTION_CONNECTION_INFO</b> option.

If the original request was redirected, the <b>WINHTTP_CONNECTION_INFO</b> structure contains the IP address and port of the request that resulted from the first non-30X response.


```cpp
WINHTTP_CONNECTION_INFO ConnInfo;
DWORD dwConnInfoSize = sizeof(WINHTTP_CONNECTION_INFO);

WinHttpQueryOption( hRequest,
                    WINHTTP_OPTION_CONNECTION_INFO,
                    &ConnInfo,
                    &dwConnInfoSize);

```
