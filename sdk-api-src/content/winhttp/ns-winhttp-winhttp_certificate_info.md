# WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO structure


## -description


The <b>WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO</b> structure contains certificate information returned from the server. This structure is used by the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/47973eab-de70-47bf-9713-97b87a500cfa">WinHttpQueryOption</a> function.


## -struct-fields




### -field ftExpiry

A 
						<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9baf8a0e-59e3-4fbd-9616-2ec9161520d1">FILETIME</a> structure that contains the date the certificate expires. 


### -field ftStart

A 
						<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9baf8a0e-59e3-4fbd-9616-2ec9161520d1">FILETIME</a> structure that contains the date the certificate becomes valid. 


### -field lpszSubjectInfo

A pointer to a buffer that contains the name of the organization, site, and server for which the certificate was issued. 


### -field lpszIssuerInfo

A pointer to a buffer that contains the name of the organization, site, and server that issued the certificate. 


### -field lpszProtocolName

A pointer to a buffer that contains the name of the protocol used to provide the secure connection. This member is not current used.


### -field lpszSignatureAlgName

A pointer to a buffer that contains the name of the algorithm used to sign the certificate. This member is not current used.


### -field lpszEncryptionAlgName

A pointer to a buffer that contains the name of the algorithm used to perform encryption over the secure channel (SSL/TLS) connection. This member is not current used.


### -field dwKeySize

The size, in bytes, of the key. 


## -remarks



The <b>WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO</b> structure contains information on the certificate returned by the server when the connection uses SSL/TLS. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/47973eab-de70-47bf-9713-97b87a500cfa">WinHttpQueryOption</a> function returns the <b>WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO</b> structure when the <i>dwOption</i> parameter passed to the <b>WinHttpQueryOption</b> function is set to <b>WINHTTP_OPTION_SECURITY_CERTIFICATE_STRUCT</b>. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2d0441f4-ddba-4f2a-8861-8803cad6f1ac">Option Flags</a>.

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/47973eab-de70-47bf-9713-97b87a500cfa">WinHttpQueryOption</a> function does not set  the <b>lpszProtocolName</b>, <b>lpszSignatureAlgName</b>, and <b>lpszEncryptionAlgName</b> members of the <b>WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO</b> structure, so these member are always returned as <b>NULL</b>.

Once the application no longer needs the returned <b>WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO</b> structure, the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a0393983-cb43-4dfa-91a6-d82a5fb8de12">LocalFree</a> function should be called to free any pointers returned in the structure. The structure members containing pointers that are not NULL and need to be freed are <b>lpszSubjectInfo</b> and <b>lpszIssuerInfo</b>.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  For Windows XP and Windows 2000, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/354ab65d-5e46-451d-b36b-2f8166a1a048">Run-Time Requirements</a> section of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/354ab65d-5e46-451d-b36b-2f8166a1a048">Windows HTTP Services</a> start page.</div>
