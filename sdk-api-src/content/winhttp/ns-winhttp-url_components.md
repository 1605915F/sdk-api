## -remarks



For the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/656dfe11-2242-4587-aa53-87a280f5df81">WinHttpCrackUrl</a> function, if a pointer member and its corresponding length member are both zero, that component of the URL is not returned. If the pointer member is <b>NULL</b> but the length member is not zero, both the pointer and length members are returned. If both pointer and corresponding length members are nonzero, the pointer member points to a buffer where the component is copied. All escape sequences can be removed from a component, depending on the 
<i>dwFlags</i> parameter of 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/656dfe11-2242-4587-aa53-87a280f5df81">WinHttpCrackUrl</a>.

For the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3f0403ea-479a-4764-ae65-d9bbd9233a50">WinHttpCreateUrl</a> function, the pointer members should be <b>NULL</b> if the component of the URL is not required. If the corresponding length member is zero, the pointer member is the pointer to a zero-terminated string. If the length member is not zero, it is the string length of the corresponding pointer member.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  For Windows XP and Windows 2000, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/354ab65d-5e46-451d-b36b-2f8166a1a048">Run-Time Requirements</a> section of the WinHttp start page.</div>
