# D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY enumeration


## -description


Specifies the shaders that can access the contents of a given root signature slot.


## -enum-fields




### -field D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY_ALL

Specifies that all shader stages can access whatever is bound at the root signature slot.


### -field D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY_VERTEX

Specifies that the vertex shader stage can access whatever is bound at the root signature slot.


### -field D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY_HULL

Specifies that the hull shader stage can access whatever is bound at the root signature slot.


### -field D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY_DOMAIN

Specifies that the domain shader stage can access whatever is bound at the root signature slot.


### -field D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY_GEOMETRY

Specifies that the geometry shader stage can access whatever is bound at the root signature slot.


### -field D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY_PIXEL

Specifies that the pixel shader stage can access whatever is bound at the root signature slot.


## -remarks



This enum is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/CC1DFE85-7F83-4551-86C6-1AFDF746FC92">D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER</a> structure.

The compute queue always uses <b>D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY_ALL</b> because it has only one active stage. The 3D queue can choose values, but if it uses <b>D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY_ALL</b>, all shader stages can access whatever is bound at the root signature slot.
