# ID3D12Device::Evict


## -description


Enables the page-out of data, which precludes GPU access of that data.


## -parameters




### -param NumObjects

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4553cafc-450e-4493-a4d4-cb6e2f274d46">UINT</a></b>

The number of objects in the <i>ppObjects</i> array to evict from the device.
          


### -param ppObjects [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/89DC88B4-9DFD-413D-8EB9-91087CC90D18">ID3D12Pageable</a>*</b>

A pointer to a memory block that contains an array of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/89DC88B4-9DFD-413D-8EB9-91087CC90D18">ID3D12Pageable</a> interface pointers for the objects.
          

Even though most D3D12 objects inherit from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/89DC88B4-9DFD-413D-8EB9-91087CC90D18">ID3D12Pageable</a>, residency changes are only supported on the following objects:
Descriptor Heaps, Heaps, Committed Resources, and Query Heaps


## -returns



Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh437604(v=VS.85).aspx">HRESULT</a></b>

This method returns one of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5F6CC962-7DB7-489F-82A4-9388313014D3">Direct3D 12 Return Codes</a>.
          




## -remarks



<b>Evict</b> persists the data associated with a resource to disk, and then removes the resource from the memory pool where it was located. This method should be called on the object which owns the physical memory: either a committed resource (which owns both virtual  and physical memory assignments) or a heap - noting that reserved resources do not have physical memory, and placed resources are borrowing memory from a heap.


Refer to the remarks for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2B3B97DC-5AA3-470E-8EED-3956B295BB94">MakeResident</a>.
