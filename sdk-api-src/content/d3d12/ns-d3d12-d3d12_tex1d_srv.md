# D3D12_TEX1D_SRV structure


## -description


Specifies the subresource from a 1D texture to use in a shader-resource view.


## -struct-fields




### -field MostDetailedMip

Index of the most detailed mipmap level to use; this number is between 0 and <b>MipLevels</b> (from the original Texture1D for which <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4FD7082D-2DA9-469E-BA74-6735D407D5FE">ID3D12Device::CreateShaderResourceView</a> creates a view) -1.


### -field MipLevels

The maximum number of mipmap levels for the view  of the texture. See the remarks.

Set to -1 to indicate all the mipmap levels from <b>MostDetailedMip</b> on down to least detailed.


### -field ResourceMinLODClamp

A value to clamp sample LOD values to. For example, if you specify 2.0f for the clamp value, you ensure that no individual sample accesses a mip level less than 2.0f.


## -remarks



This structure is one member of a shader-resource-view description, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2B4B868F-3E9F-4570-B1C7-2767ED717A3B">D3D12_SHADER_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC</a>.

As an example, assuming <b>MostDetailedMip</b> = 6 and <b>MipLevels</b> = 2, the view will have access to 2 mipmap levels, 6 and 7, of the original texture for which <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4FD7082D-2DA9-469E-BA74-6735D407D5FE">ID3D12Device::CreateShaderResourceView</a> creates the view. In this situation, <b>MostDetailedMip</b> is greater than the <b>MipLevels</b> in the view. However, <b>MostDetailedMip</b> is not greater than the <b>MipLevels</b> in the original resource.
