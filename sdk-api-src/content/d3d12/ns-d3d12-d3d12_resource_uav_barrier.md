# D3D12_RESOURCE_UAV_BARRIER structure


## -description


Represents a resource in which all UAV accesses must complete before any future UAV accesses can begin.
        


## -struct-fields




### -field pResource

The resource used in the transition, as a pointer to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/AF453D2F-F0FD-4552-A843-84119A829CD5">ID3D12Resource</a>.
          


## -remarks



This struct represents a resource in which all unordered access view (UAV) accesses (reads or writes) must complete before any future UAV accesses (read or write) can begin.
      

This structure is a member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/49F02D65-767E-4BA4-A90D-68AA2D709E09">D3D12_RESOURCE_BARRIER</a> structure.
      

You don't need to insert a UAV barrier between 2 draw or dispatch calls that only read a UAV.
        Additionally, you don't need to insert a UAV barrier between 2 draw or dispatch calls that write to the same UAV if you know that it's safe to execute the UAV accesses in any order.
        The resource can be <b>NULL</b>, which indicates that any UAV access could require the barrier.
