# D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY enumeration


## -description


Defines priority levels for a command queue.


## -enum-fields




### -field D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_NORMAL

Normal priority.


### -field D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH

High priority.


### -field D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_GLOBAL_REALTIME

Global realtime priority.


## -remarks



This enumeration is used by the <b>Priority</b> member of the
          <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8C43C45B-0A7B-4336-B546-1E6F13D153F3">D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_DESC</a>structure.
        

An application must be sufficiently privileged in order to create a command queue that has global realtime priority. If the application is not sufficiently privileged or if neither the adapter or driver can provide the necessary preemption, then requests to create a global realtime priority queue fail; such a failure could be due to a lack of hardware support or due to conflicts with other command queue parameters. Requests to create a global realtime command queue won't silently downgrade the priority when it can't be supported; the request succeeds or fails as-is to indicate to the application whether or not the command queue is guaranteed to execute before any other queue.
