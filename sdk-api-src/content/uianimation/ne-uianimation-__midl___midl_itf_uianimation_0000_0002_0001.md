Unless <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8ee9a17f-c57c-49df-950d-491e05ba8768">IUIAnimationStoryboard::GetStatus</a> is called from a handler for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e1ccf0e3-64fc-444e-a27b-1a5bc1d9d6fd">OnStoryboardStatusChanged</a> events, it returns only the following status values:

<ul>
<li>UI_ANIMATION_STORYBOARD_BUILDING</li>
<li>UI_ANIMATION_STORYBOARD_SCHEDULED</li>
<li>UI_ANIMATION_STORYBOARD_PLAYING</li>
<li>UI_ANIMATION_STORYBOARD_READY</li>
</ul>
All status values can be passed to  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e1ccf0e3-64fc-444e-a27b-1a5bc1d9d6fd">IUIAnimationStoryboardEventHandler::OnStoryboardStatusChanged</a>.
