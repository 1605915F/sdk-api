# PPP_EAP_INFO structure


## -description


The 
<b>PPP_EAP_INFO</b> structure provides information to the Connection Manager about the authentication protocol, including pointers to functions located in the EAP DLL.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwSizeInBytes

Specifies the size of the 
<b>PPP_EAP_INFO</b> structure. RAS passes in this value to the EAP DLL. The DLL uses this value to determine which version of the 
<b>PPP_EAP_INFO</b> structure RAS is using.


### -field dwEapTypeId

Specifies a particular authentication protocol. This identifier must be unique throughout industry-wide implementation of EAP. The implementer of an authentication protocol must obtain this identifier from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).


### -field RasEapInitialize

Pointer to the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f689e89e-b4c4-4167-99ed-0531a6c05267">RasEapInitialize</a> function for the authentication protocol. The authentication protocol sets the value of this member. The authentication protocol may set this member to <b>NULL</b>, in which case the protocol does not require RAS to call this function.



#### fInitialize

Specifies whether the authentication protocol should initialize or de-initialize. This parameter is <b>TRUE</b> if the protocol initializes and <b>FALSE</b> if the protocol does not initialize.


### -field RasEapBegin

Pointer to the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f5f9be64-25c5-42c8-8a08-1457e04e3c45">RasEapBegin</a> function for the requested authentication protocol. The authentication protocol sets the value of this member. This member may be <b>NULL</b>, in which case, the authentication protocol does not require any initialization. If this member is <b>NULL</b>, RAS ignores the <b>RasEapEnd</b> member.



#### ppWorkBuffer

Pointer to a pointer that, on successful return, points to a work buffer. This buffer is opaque to RAS; the contents of the buffer are used only by the authentication protocol. The RAS connection manager passes a pointer to this buffer to the authentication protocol in subsequent calls to 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8e38c155-2fa0-42c8-a843-c90e4f3f8854">RasEapMakeMessage</a>.



#### pPppEapInput

Pointer to a 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/80a8f118-323d-4040-91f7-202eeee6d227">PPP_EAP_INPUT</a> structure that specifies initialization information for the authentication session.


### -field RasEapEnd

Pointer to the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/52204bc6-03ed-4e8c-819f-b54174ccdbd4">RasEapEnd</a> function for the authentication protocol. The authentication protocol sets the value of this member.



#### pWorkBuffer

Pointer to the work buffer to free.


### -field RasEapMakeMessage

Pointer to the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8e38c155-2fa0-42c8-a843-c90e4f3f8854">RasEapMakeMessage</a> function for the requested authentication protocol. The authentication protocol sets the value of this member.



#### pWorkBuf

Pointer to the work buffer. The authentication protocol provides RAS with a pointer to this buffer via the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f5f9be64-25c5-42c8-8a08-1457e04e3c45">RasEapBegin</a> function.



#### pReceivePacket

Pointer to a 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a1ca16d1-bf91-4986-a4f8-6e6ad382730f">PPP_EAP_PACKET</a> structure that contains a received packet. A <i>pReceivePacket</i> value of <b>NULL</b> indicates either that RAS is initiating the dialog with the authentication protocol, or that a time out has occurred and the authentication protocol should resend the last packet. The authentication protocol must determine, based on context, which of these two cases is true.



#### pSendPacket

Pointer to a 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a1ca16d1-bf91-4986-a4f8-6e6ad382730f">PPP_EAP_PACKET</a> structure. The authentication protocol can use this structure to specify a packet to send.



#### cbSendPacket

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pSendPacket</i>.



#### pEapOutput

Pointer to a 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d1634973-f6af-4be3-914a-513098c5fccf">PPP_EAP_OUTPUT</a> structure.



#### pEapInput

Pointer to a 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/80a8f118-323d-4040-91f7-202eeee6d227">PPP_EAP_INPUT</a> structure. This parameter may be <b>NULL</b>.


## -remarks



A given EAP DLL may implement more than one authentication protocol. Use the <b>dwEapTypeId</b> member to specify for which protocol to retrieve information.
