# GetGamingDeviceModelInformation function


## -description


Gets  information about the device that the game is running on.


## -parameters




### -param information [out]

A structure containing information about the device that the game is running on.


## -returns



This function does not return a value.




## -remarks



This is a Win32 API that's supported in both Win32 and UWP apps. While it works on any device family, it's only really of value on Xbox devices.

This function gets information about the console that the game is running on, including the type of console (Xbox One, Xbox One S, etc.) and the vendor. On non-Xbox devices, it returns <b>GAMING_DEVICE_DEVICE_ID_NONE</b> and <b>GAMING_DEVICE_VENDOR_ID_NONE</b>.

If the game is running in an emulation mode, the type of device being emulated is returned. For example, if the game is running on an Xbox One X dev kit in Xbox One emulation mode, <b>GAMING_DEVICE_DEVICE_ID_XBOX_ONE</b> is returned.
