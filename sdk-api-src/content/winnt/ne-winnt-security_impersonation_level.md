# SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL enumeration


## -description


The <b>SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL</b> enumeration contains values that specify security impersonation levels. Security impersonation levels govern the degree to which a server process can act on behalf of a client <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2fe6cfd3-8a2e-4dbe-9fb8-332633daa97a">process</a>.


## -enum-fields




### -field SecurityAnonymous

The server process cannot obtain identification information about the client, and it cannot impersonate the client. It is defined with no value given, and thus, by ANSI C rules, defaults to a value of zero.


### -field SecurityIdentification

The server process can obtain information about the client, such as security identifiers and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2fe6cfd3-8a2e-4dbe-9fb8-332633daa97a">privileges</a>, but it cannot impersonate the client. This is useful for servers that export their own objects, for example, database products that export tables and views. Using the retrieved client-security information, the server can make access-validation decisions without being able to use other services that are using the client's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3e9d7672-2314-45c8-8178-5a0afcfd0c50">security context</a>.


### -field SecurityImpersonation

The server process can impersonate the client's security context on its local system. The server cannot impersonate the client on remote systems.


### -field SecurityDelegation

The server process can impersonate the client's security context on remote systems. 





## -remarks



Impersonation is the ability of a process to take on the security attributes of another process.
