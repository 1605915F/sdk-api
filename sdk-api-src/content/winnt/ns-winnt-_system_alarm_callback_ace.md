# _SYSTEM_ALARM_CALLBACK_ACE structure


## -description


Not supported.

The <b>SYSTEM_ALARM_CALLBACK_ACE</b> structure is reserved for future use.


## -struct-fields




### -field Header


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d23f15d6-0453-4aaf-a2db-7528b551a992">ACE_HEADER</a> structure that specifies the size and type of ACE. It also contains flags that control inheritance of the ACE by child objects. The <b>AceType</b> member of the <b>ACE_HEADER</b> structure should be set to SYSTEM_ALARM_CALLBACK_ACE_TYPE.


### -field Mask

Specifies an 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f115ee54-3333-4109-8004-d71904a7a943">ACCESS_MASK</a> structure that gives the access rights that cause audit messages to be generated. The SUCCESSFUL_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG and FAILED_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG flags in the <b>AceFlags</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d23f15d6-0453-4aaf-a2db-7528b551a992">ACE_HEADER</a> structure indicate whether messages are generated for successful access attempts, unsuccessful access attempts, or both.


### -field SidStart

The first <b>DWORD</b> of a trustee's ACE. This ACE can be appended with application data. When the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e8a510e6-0739-4765-ad07-3bcb1b9c905c">AuthzAccessCheckCallback</a> function is called, this ACE is passed as the <i>pAce</i> parameter of that function.


## -remarks



ACE structures must be aligned on <b>DWORD</b> boundaries. All Windows memory-management functions return <b>DWORD</b>-aligned handles to memory.
