# IDWriteTextFormat::SetReadingDirection


## -description


Sets the paragraph reading direction.


## -parameters




### -param readingDirection

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/37288d34-d533-474c-b3c0-8c6361074a9b">DWRITE_READING_DIRECTION</a></b>

The text reading direction (for example, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/37288d34-d533-474c-b3c0-8c6361074a9b">DWRITE_READING_DIRECTION_RIGHT_TO_LEFT</a> for languages, such as 
            Arabic, that read from right to left) for a paragraph.
          


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The reading direction and flow direction must always be set 90 degrees orthogonal to each other, or else you will get the error DWRITE_E_FLOWDIRECTIONCONFLICTS when you 
        use layout functions like Draw or GetMetrics. So if you set a vertical reading direction (for example, to DWRITE_READING_DIRECTION_TOP_TO_BOTTOM), then you must also 
        use SetFlowDirection to set the flow direction appropriately (for example, to DWRITE_FLOW_DIRECTION_RIGHT_TO_LEFT).
