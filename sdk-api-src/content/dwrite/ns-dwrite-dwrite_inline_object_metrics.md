## -description


Contains properties describing the geometric measurement of an
application-defined inline object.


## -struct-fields




### -field width

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The width of the inline object.


### -field height

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The height of the inline object.


### -field baseline

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The distance from the top of the object to the point where it is lined up with the adjacent text. 
     If the baseline is at the bottom, then <b>baseline</b> simply equals <b>height</b>.


### -field supportsSideways

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

A Boolean flag that indicates whether the object is to be placed upright or alongside the text baseline for vertical text.
